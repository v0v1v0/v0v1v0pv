<h2>Emission factor that incorporates the effect of high emitters</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><code>ef_whe</code> return weighted emission factors of vehicles considering
that one part of the fleet has a normal deterioration and another has a
deteriorated fleet that would be rejected in a inspection and mantainence
program but it is still in circulation. This emission factor might be
applicable in cities without a inspection and mantainence program and with
Weighted emission factors considering that part of the fleet are high emitters.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">ef_whe(efhe, phe, ef)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>efhe</code></td>
<td>
<p>Numeric; Emission factors of high emitters vehicles. This vehicles
would be rejected in a inspection and mantainnence program.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>phe</code></td>
<td>
<p>Numeric; Percentage of high emitters.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>ef</code></td>
<td>
<p>Numeric; Emission factors deteriorated vehicles under normal
conditions. These vehicles would be approved in a inspection and mantainence
program.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>An emission factor by annual mileage.
</p>


<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">{
# Do not run
# Let's say high emitter is 5 times the normal ef.
co_efhe &lt;- ef_cetesb(p = "COd", "PC_G") * 5
# Let's say that the perfil of high emitters increases linearly
# till 30 years and after that percentage is constant
perc &lt;- c(seq(0.01, 0.3, 0.01), rep(0.3, 10))
# Now, lets use our ef with normal deterioration
co_ef_normal &lt;- ef_cetesb(p = "COd", "PC_G")
efd &lt;- ef_whe(efhe = co_efhe,
              phe = perc,
              ef = co_ef_normal)
# now, we can plot the three ef
colplot(data.frame(co_efhe, co_ef_normal, efd))
