</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Starting on the 10th July, 1723,
the crew of the <em>Ranger</em> were judged.
The captain of the ship was Charles Harris,
and this ship was one of two pirate ships under Captain Edward Low. 
Their personal data (name, age, place of birth) and verdicts
are recorded in Johnson (1955).
This data was constructed from pp.295â€“296 of that book
and includes those who were not found guilty (and therefore
were not executed).
The execution of the 25 men were performed on 19 July
near Newport, Rhode Island, USA.
The notorious pirate Edward Low himself was brought to
trial in 1724 under different
circumstances and was hanged in Martinique.
