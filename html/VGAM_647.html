<h3>Description</h3>

<p>General Electric and Westinghouse capital data.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data(gew)</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame with 20 observations on the following 7 variables.
All variables are numeric vectors.
Variables ending in <code>.g</code> correspond to General Electric and
those ending in <code>.w</code> are Westinghouse.
</p>

<dl>
<dt>year</dt>
<dd>
<p>The observations are the years from 1934 to 1953</p>
</dd>
<dt>invest.g, invest.w</dt>
<dd>
<p>investment figures.
These are <code class="reqn">I=</code> Gross investment =
additions to plant and equipment plus maintenance and repairs
in millions of dollars deflated by <code class="reqn">P_1</code>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>capital.g, capital.w</dt>
<dd>
<p>capital stocks.
These are <code class="reqn">C=</code> The stock of plant and equipment =
accumulated sum of net additions to plant and equipment deflated
by <code class="reqn">P_1</code> minus depreciation allowance deflated by <code class="reqn">P_3</code>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>value.g, value.w</dt>
<dd>
<p>market values.
These are <code class="reqn">F=</code> Value of the firm =

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>These data are a subset of a table in Boot and de Wit (1960),
also known as the Grunfeld data.
It is used a lot in econometrics,
e.g., for seemingly unrelated regressions
(see <code>SURff</code>).
</p>
<p>Here,
<code class="reqn">P_1 =</code> Implicit price deflator of producers durable
equipment (base 1947),
<code class="reqn">P_2 =</code> Implicit price deflator of G.N.P.
(base 1947),
<code class="reqn">P_3 =</code> Depreciation expense deflator = ten years
moving average of wholesale price index of metals and metal
products (base 1947).
