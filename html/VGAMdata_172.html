<h2> 2008 World Fly Fishing Championships Data</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Capture records of the 2008 FIPS-MOUCHE
World Fly Fishing Championships held in Rotorua,
New Zealand during
22–30 March 2008.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data(wffc)</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame with 4267 observations on the
following 8 variables.
Each row is a recorded capture.
</p>

<dl>
<dt><code>length</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>a numeric vector; length of fish in mm.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>water</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>a factor with levels
<code>Waihou</code>, <code>Waimakariri</code>, <code>Whanganui</code>,
<code>Otamangakau</code>, <code>Rotoaira</code>.
These are known as Sectors IV, V, I, II, III respectively,
and are also represented by the variable <code>sector</code>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>session</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>a numeric vector;
a value from the set 1,2,...,6.
These are time ordered, and there were two sessions
per competition day.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>sector</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>a numeric vector; a value from
the set 1,2,...,5.
Ideally these should be converted to a factor.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>beatboat</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>a numeric vector; beat or boat number,
a value from the set 1,2,...,19.
Ideally these should be converted to a factor.
For a river though, they are contiguous whereas
on a lake it is less so.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>comid</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>a numeric vector; the
competitor's ID number.
Uniquely identifies each competitor.
These ID numbers actually correspond to their rankings
in the individual level. </p>
</dd>
<dt><code>iname</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>a character vector; the
individual competitor's name. </p>
</dd>
<dt><code>country</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>a character vector;
what country the competitors represented.
The countries represented were
Australia (AUS),
Canada (CAN),
Croatia (CRO),
Czech Republic (CZE),
England (ENG),
Finland (FIN),
France (FRA),
Holland (NED),
Ireland (IRE),
Italy (ITA),
Japan (JPN),
Malta (MAL),
New Zealand (NZL),
Poland (POL),
Portugal (POR),
South Africa (RSA),
Slovakia (SVK),
USA (USA),
Wales (WAL).

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Details may be obtained at Yee (2010) and Yee (2014).
Here is a brief summary.
The three competition days were 28–30 March.
Each session was fixed at 9.00am–12.00pm
and 2.30–5.30pm daily.
One of the sessions was a rest session.
Each of 19 teams had 5 members, called A, B, C, D and E
(there was a composite team, actually).
The scoring system allocated 100 points to each
eligible fish
(minimum length was 18 cm)
and 20 points for each cm of its length
(rounded up to the nearest centimeter).
Thus a 181mm or 190mm fish was worth 480 points.
Each river was divided into 19 contiguous
downstream beats labelled
1,2,...,19.
Each lake was fished by 9 boats, each with two competitors
except for one boat which only had one.
Each competitor was randomly assigned to a beat/boat.
</p>
<p>Competitors were ranked according to their placings
at each sector-session
combination, and then these placings were summed.
Those with the minimum
total placings were the winners, thus it was not
necessarily those who had
the maximum points who won. For example,
in Session 1 at the Waihou River,
each of the 19 competitors was ranked 1 (best)
to 19 (worst) according
to the point system. This is the “placing” for
that session. These
placings were added up over the 5 sessions to
give the “total placings”.
</p>
<p>All sectors have naturally wild Rainbow trout
(<em>Oncorhynchus mykiss</em>)
while Lake Otamangakau and the Whanganui River
also holds Brown trout
(<em>Salmo trutta</em>). Only these two species
were targetted.
The species was not recorded electronically,
however a post-analysis
of the paper score sheets from the two lakes
showed that, approximately,
less than 5 percent were Brown trout.
It may be safely assumed that all the Waihou
and Waimakariri
fish were Rainbow trout.
The gender of the fish were also not recorded
electronically, and
anyway, distinguishing between male and female
was very difficult
for small fish.
</p>
<p>Although species and gender data were supposed to have been
collected at the time of capture the quality of
these variables
is rather poor and furthermore they were
not recorded electronically.
</p>





<p>Note that some fish may have been caught
more than once, hence
these data do not represent individual fish
but rather recorded captures.
</p>
<p>Note also that a few internal discrepancies
may be found within
and between the data frames
<code>wffc</code>,
<code>wffc.nc</code>,
<code>wffc.indiv</code>,
<code>wffc.teams</code>.
This is due to various reasons, such as
competitors being replaced by reserves when sick,
fish that were included or excluded upon the
local judge's decision,
competitors who fished two hours instead of
three by mistake, etc.
The data has already been cleaned of errors
and internal inconsistencies
but a few may remain.
