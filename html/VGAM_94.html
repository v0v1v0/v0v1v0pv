<h2> Bayesian Information Criterion </h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Calculates the Bayesian information criterion (BIC) for
a fitted model object for which a log-likelihood value
has been obtained.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">BICvlm(object, ..., k = log(nobs(object)))
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>object, ...</code></td>
<td>

<p>Same as <code>AICvlm</code>.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>k</code></td>
<td>

<p>Numeric, the penalty per parameter to be used;
the default is <code>log(n)</code> where
<code>n</code> is the number of observations).
</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The so-called BIC or SBC (Schwarz's Bayesian criterion)
can be computed by calling <code>AICvlm</code> with a
different <code>k</code> argument.
See <code>AICvlm</code> for information and caveats.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>Returns a numeric value with the corresponding BIC, or ...,
depending on <code>k</code>.
</p>


<h3>Warning </h3>

<p>Like <code>AICvlm</code>, this code has not been double-checked.
The general applicability of <code>BIC</code> for the VGLM/VGAM classes
has not been developed fully.
In particular, <code>BIC</code> should not be run on some <span class="pkg">VGAM</span> family
functions because of violation of certain regularity conditions, etc.
</p>
<p>Many <span class="pkg">VGAM</span> family functions such as
<code>cumulative</code> can have the number of
observations absorbed into the prior weights argument
(e.g., <code>weights</code> in <code>vglm</code>), either
before or after fitting.  Almost all <span class="pkg">VGAM</span> family
functions can have the number of observations defined by
the <code>weights</code> argument, e.g., as an observed frequency.
<code>BIC</code> simply uses the number of rows of the model matrix, say,
as defining <code>n</code>, hence the user must be very careful
of this possible error.
Use at your own risk!!
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>BIC, AIC and other ICs can have have many additive
constants added to them. The important thing are the
differences since the minimum value corresponds to the best model.




</p>
<p>BIC has not been defined for QRR-VGLMs yet.
