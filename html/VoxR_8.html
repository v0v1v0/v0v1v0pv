<h2>Clustering of non connected objects in a point cloud.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Clustering objects with non common points: two points located within a user defined distance from each other are considered
as the parts of a unique object. This function is well suited to be applied to the outputs of the
substract_point_clouds function.

<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">distance_clustering(data, d_clust, method, C_size, message)

distance_clustering(data, d_clust, method, C_size, message)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>data</code></td>
<td>
<p>a data.frame or data.table containing the x, y, z, ... coordinates of a point cloud or voxel cloud.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>d_clust</code></td>
<td>
<p>numeric. The distance required to consider two points as being part of two different clusters. Default = 0.02.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>method</code></td>
<td>
<p>character. The algorithm to use for clustering. Can be either "D_mat" or "Iter", see details. Default = "D_mat".</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>C_size</code></td>
<td>
<p>(optional) numeric. If <code>method = "Iter"</code>, sets the maximal size of a cluster (in distance unit).</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>message</code></td>
<td>
<p>logical. If FALSE, messages are disabled. Default = TRUE.</p>
</td>
</tr>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>If <code>method == "D_mat"</code> the clustering process is based on building a matrix distance. This is time efficient but use a lot of memory.
If <code>method == "Iter"</code> a slower but memory efficient iterative process is used. In some cases, D_clust can help to speed up the process.

<h3>Value</h3>

<p>The input data with an additionnal field containing the cluster ID.
