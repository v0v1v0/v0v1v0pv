<h2>Calculates the duration of the median (or other percentile) flooding event</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Calculates the duration of the median (or other percentile) flooding event
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">dur.events(level, elevation, percentile = 0.5, units = "1 observation")
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>level</code></td>
<td>
<p>a numeric vector of water levels or tide data</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>elevation</code></td>
<td>
<p>elevation(s) of interest (e.g., marsh platform, MHW). A vector 
of elevations is accepted. Elevation should be in the same vertical datum as <code>level</code></p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>percentile</code></td>
<td>
<p>the percentile(s) to find (median flooding event is used by default)</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>units</code></td>
<td>
<p>the time interval between measurements. This argument enables conversion of 
flooding durations to hours. <code>units</code> must be a string of the form <code>XX units</code>, 
where <code>XX</code> is an integer and <code>units</code> can be <code>second</code>, <code>minute</code>, 
<code>hour</code>, or their plurals. When time units are specified, all time units are 
converted to hours in output. When units are not specified, the output reports the 
number of sequential observations</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The duration of individual flooding events is calculated from water level data.
<code>dur.events()</code> differs from <code>fld.dur()</code> in that the former examines 
individual flooding events, rather than cumulative inundation times.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>the duration of the median (or other percentile) flooding event occurring at a given 
elevation. If <code>percentile</code> is of length one, the value(s) returned are the 
corresponding flooding duration percentiles for the elevation(s) of interest. To ensure 
clarity when more than one <code>percentile</code> is sought, in those cases a dataframe is 
output to report elevations and flooding durations
</p>


<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data(NL_6min_2013)
MHW &lt;- 0.9117  # New London MHW in 2013: 0.9117 m relative to MLLW

# median flooding duration at three elevations
dur.events(NL_6min_2013[, 2], elevation = c(0.5, MHW, 1.5), units = "6 minutes")

# a dataframe is output when results are more complex
dur.events(NL_6min_2013[, 2], elevation = MHW, 
           percentile = c(0.1, 0.5, 0.9), units = "6 minutes")
dur.events(NL_6min_2013[, 2], elevation = c(0.5, MHW, 1.5), 
  percentile = c(0.1, 0.5, 0.9), units = "6 minutes")

# dur.events() differs from fld.dur() in that it examines individual
# flooding events, rather than cumulative inundation

# The median flooding event at MHW lasts 2.9 hrs
dur.events(NL_6min_2013[, 2], elevation = MHW, units = "6 minutes")

# And over an entire year, MHW was flooded 13% of the time
fld.dur(z = MHW, NL_6min_2013[, 2])
