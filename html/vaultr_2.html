<h2>Vault Client for Secrets and Sensitive Data</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Vault client for secrets and sensitive data; this package provides
wrappers for HashiCorp's <a href="https://vaultproject.io">vault server</a>.
The package wraps most of the high-level API, and includes support
for authentication via a number of backends (tokens, username and
password, github, and "AppRole"), as well as a number of secrets
engines (two key-value stores, vault's cubbyhole and the transit
backend for encryption-as-a-service).
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>To get started, you might want to start with the "vaultr"
vignette, available from the package with <code>vignette("vaultr")</code>.
</p>
<p>The basic design of the package is that it has very few
entrypoints - for most uses one will interact almost entirely with
the vault_client function.  That function returns an
R6 object with several methods (functions) but also several
objects that themselves contain more methods and objects, creating
a nested tree of functionality.
</p>
<p>From any object, online help is available via the help method, for
example
</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre>client &lt;- vaultr::vault_client()
client$secrets$transit$help()
</pre></div>
<p>For testing packages that rely on vault, there is support for
creating temporary vault servers; see <code>vaultr::vault_test_server</code>
and the "packages" vignette.
