<h2>veccompare: Automatically Generate All n-Wise Set Comparisons on Vectors</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The <span class="pkg">veccompare</span> package contains functions for automating set operations. Given a named list of 5 vectors, for example, <span class="pkg">veccompare</span> can calculate all 2-, 3-, 4-, and 5-way comparisons between those vectors, recording information for each comparison about the set "union" (combined elements), "intersection" (overlap / shared elements), and compliments (which elements are unique to each vector involved in the comparison).
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The veccompare package contains functions for automating set operations (i.e., comparisons of overlap) between multiple vectors.
</p>
<p>The package also contains a function for automating reporting in RMarkdown, by generating markdown output for easy analysis, as well as an RMarkdown template for use with RStudio.
</p>
<p>The primary function from <span class="pkg">veccompare</span> is <code>compare.vectors</code>. Complementarily, <code>compare.vectors.and.return.text.analysis.of.overlap</code> will call <code>compare.vectors</code> and generate Markdown-style output from it (for example, for use within an RMarkdown file).
</p>
<p>An RMarkdown template illustrating several of <span class="pkg">veccompare</span>'s features can be used from within RStudio by clicking <code>File -&gt; New File -&gt; R Markdown... -&gt; From Template -&gt; Veccompare Overlap Report</code>.
</p>
<p><span class="pkg">veccompare</span> also provides a function, <code>summarize.two.way.comparisons.percentage.overlap</code>, that can create correlation-plot-style images and network graphs for all two-way comparisons between vectors. This function is also demonstrated in the <code>Veccompare Overlap Report</code> described above.
