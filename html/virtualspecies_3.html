<h2>Convert a virtual species distribution (or a suitability raster) 
into presence-absence</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This functions converts the probabilities of presence from the output of
<code>generateSpFromFun</code>, <code>generateSpFromPCA</code>, 
<code>generateRandomSp</code>
or a suitability raster into
a presence-absence raster. The conversion can be threshold-based, or based
on a probability of conversion (see details).
</p>

  x,
  PA.method = "probability",
  prob.method = "logistic",
  beta = "random",
  alpha = -0.05,
  a = NULL,
  b = NULL,
  species.prevalence = NULL,
  plot = TRUE

</p>
<p>The conversion of environmental suitability into presence - absence used to 
be
performed by selecting a threshold above which presence always occurs,
and never below. However, this approach may is unrealistic because
species may sometime be present in areas with a low probability of 
occurrence,
or be absent from areas with a high probability of occurrence. In addition,
when using a threshold you erase the previously generated response shapes: 
it all becomes threshold. Thus, this threshold approach should be avoided.
</p>
<p>A more
realistic conversion consists in converting environmental suitability into
presence -
absence with a probability function (see references). Such a probability 
conversion can be performed with two different methods here:
</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>Using a logistic transformation of  environmental suitability
(see <code>logisticFun</code>). A logistic function on the other hand, will 
ensure that the simulated probability is within the 0-1 range and allow easy 
control of species prevalence. However, the 
logistic function will also flatten out the relationship at the extreme 
suitability values, and narrow or broaden the intermediate probability values
depending on the slope of the logistic curve 
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Using a linear transformation of environmental suitability. A linear 
transformation will preserve the shape of the originally simulated 
occurrence-environment relationships, uniformly increasing or decreasing the
probabilities of occurrence across the landscape.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>— note —
</p>
<p>If the Virtual Species study aims at comparing simulated and predicted 
probability values, it is important to recover the correct simulated 
probability instead of directly using the initial suitability function. 
</p>
<p>Therefore, the function stores the probability of occurrence in the 
output list, under the object <code>probability.of.occurrence</code>.
The initial suitability function (before logistic or linear conversion)
will still be stored in the output list as <code>suitab.raster</code>. 
</p>
<p>————————————————————————–
</p>
<p><b>PROBABILISTIC CONVERSION - LOGISTIC METHOD</b>
</p>
<p>To perform the logistic transformation of environmental suitability
you have to define two of the
three following parameters:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p><code>beta</code>: the 'threshold' of the logistic function (i.e. the 
inflexion point. It should normaly be in the range of values of your 
environmental suitability.)
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>alpha</code>: the slope of the logistic function. It should generally
be in value equal to something like 1/20 or 1/10 of your environmental 
suitability range
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>species.prevalence</code>: the proportion of sites in which the species
occur
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If you provide <code>beta</code> and <code>alpha</code>, the <code>species.prevalence</code>
is calculated immediately calculated after conversion into presence-absence.
</p>
<p>On the other hand, if you provide <code>species.prevalence</code> and either
<code>beta</code> or <code>alpha</code>, the function will try to determine <code>alpha</code>
(if you provided <code>beta</code>) or <code>beta</code> (if you provided <code>alpha</code>).
</p>
<p>The relationship between species prevalence, alpha and beta is dependent
on the available range of environmental conditions (see Meynard and Kaplan,
2011 and especially the Supporting Information). As a consequence, the 
desired species prevalence may not be available for the defined <code>alpha</code> 
or <code>beta</code>. In these conditions, the function will retain the 
<code>alpha</code> or
<code>beta</code> which provides the closest prevalence to your 
<code>species.prevalence</code>,
but you may also provide another value of <code>alpha</code> or <code>beta</code> to 
obtain
a closer prevalence. 
</p>
<p>————————————————————————–
</p>
<p><b>PROBABILISTIC CONVERSION - LINEAR METHOD </b>
</p>
<p>To perform the linear transformation of environmental suitability
you have to define *one* of the following:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>nothing - in which case your input environmental suitability will be
used as the probability of occurrence for the Bernoulli trial (it is 
equivalent to defining a slope <code>a</code> of 1 and intercept <code>b</code> of  0.)
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the coefficients of the linear regression: slope <code>a</code> and 
intercept <code>b</code>. The transformed environmental suitability will
be used as the probability of occurrence for the Bernoulli trial.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>species.prevalence</code>: the proportion of sites in which the 
species occur. In this case, the function will try to find coefficients
of a linear regression which results in the requested 
<code>species.prevalence</code>
(see below).
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Method used to find coefficients of a linear regression which results in the
requested <code>species.prevalence</code>:
</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>The simplest linear transformation of habitat suitability would
be to just multiply the raw suitability by a constant. For example, if the 
raw average suitability in the area is 0.04, it means an expected prevalence
of 0.40. To to go from this expected prevalence of 0.04 to an expected
prevalence of 0.4, we can just multiply the raw suitability by 10. It is the
default choice, unless it results in probabilities superior to 1 or raw
suitability have values below 0, in which case the function proceeds to
method 2.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If it does not work, then we look at the line that passes through 
(min suitability, 0) and (mean suitability, desired prevalence). For this 
line, we only need to ensure that the maximum probability of occurence is 
lower than 1. Otherwise, the function proceeds to method 3.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If method 2 fails, then we test the line going through (mean 
suitability, desired prevalence) and (max suitability, 1). If the minimum
probability resulting from this line is greater than 0, then this method is 
correct.

</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>One of these 3 lines should always work. In fact, one of the last two has to 
work, and it does not hurt to try the first one which is simpler.
</p>
<p>————————————————————————–
</p>
<p>In all cases, the <code>species.prevalence</code> indicated in the output is the
prevalence measured on the output presence-absence map.
</p>
