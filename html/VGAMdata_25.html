<h2> DeLury's Method for Population Size Estimation </h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Computes DeLury's method or Leslie's method for estimating a
biological population size.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">DeLury(catch, effort, type = c("DeLury","Leslie"), ricker = FALSE)

</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>catch, effort</code></td>
<td>

<p>Catch and effort. These should be numeric vectors of equal length.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>type</code></td>
<td>

<p>Character specifying which of the DeLury or Leslie models is to be fitted.
The default is the first value.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>ricker</code></td>
<td>

<p>Logical. If <code>TRUE</code> then the Ricker (1975) modification is computed.

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This simple function implements the methods of DeLury (1947).
These are called the DeLury and Leslie models.
Note that there are many assumptions.
These include: (i) Catch and effort records are available for a series
of consecutive time intervals. The catch for a given time
interval, specified by <code class="reqn">t</code>, is <code class="reqn">c(t)</code>, and the
corresponding effort by <code class="reqn">e(t)</code>.
The <em>catch per unit effort</em> (CPUE) for the time interval <code class="reqn">t</code> is
<code class="reqn">C(t) = c(t)/e(t)</code>.
Let <code class="reqn">d(t)</code> represent the proportion of the population
captured during the time interval <code class="reqn">t</code>.
Then <code class="reqn">d(t) = k(t) e(t)</code> so that <code class="reqn">k(t)</code> is the
proportion of the population captured during interval <code class="reqn">t</code> by one unit
of effort. Then <code class="reqn">k(t)</code> is called the <em>catchability</em>,
and the <em>intensity</em> of effort is <code class="reqn">e(t)</code>.
Let <code class="reqn">E(t)</code> and <code class="reqn">K(t)</code> be the total effort and total catch
up to interval <code class="reqn">t</code>, and <code class="reqn">N(t)</code> be the number of individuals
in the population at time <code class="reqn">t</code>.
It is good idea to plot
<code class="reqn">\log(C(t))</code> against <code class="reqn">E(t)</code> for <code>type = "DeLury"</code> and
<code class="reqn">C(t)</code> versus <code class="reqn">K(t)</code> for <code>type = "Leslie"</code>.
</p>
<p>The other assumptions are as follows.

(ii) The population is closed—the population must be closed to sources
of animals such as recruitment and immigration and losses of animals
due to natural mortality and emigration.

(iii) Catchability is constant over the period of removals.

(iv) The units of effort are independent, i.e., the individual units
of the method of capture (i.e., nets, traps, etc) do not compete with
each other.

(v) All fish are equally vulnerable to the method of capture—source
of error may include gear saturation and trap-happy or trap-shy
individuals.

(vi) Enough fish must be removed to substantially reduce the CPUE.

(vii) The catches may remove less than 2% of the population.

Also, the usual assumptions of simple regression such as

(viii) random sampling,

(ix) the independent variable(s) are measured without error—both
catches and effort should be known, not estimated,

(x) a line describes the data,

(xi) the errors are independent and normally distributed.

<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A list with the following components.
</p>
<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>catch, effort </code></td>
<td>

<p>Catch and effort. Same as the original vectors.
These correspond to <code class="reqn">c(t)</code> and <code class="reqn">e(t)</code> respectively.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>type, ricker</code></td>
<td>
<p>Same as input.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>N0</code></td>
<td>
<p>an estimate of the population size at time 0.
Only valid if the assumptions are satisfied.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>CPUE</code></td>
<td>
<p>Catch Per Unit Effort <code class="reqn">=C(t)</code>. </p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>K, E</code></td>
<td>

<p><code class="reqn">K(t)</code> and <code class="reqn">E(t)</code>.
Only one is computed depending on <code>type</code>.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>lmfit</code></td>
<td>

<p>the <code>lm</code> object from the
fit of <code>log(CPUE)</code> on <code>K</code> (when <code>type = "Leslie"</code>).
Note that the <code>x</code> component of the object is the model matrix.
</p>

<h3>Note</h3>

<p>The data in the example below comes from DeLury (1947), and
some plots of his are reproduced.
Note that he used log to base 10 whereas natural logs are used here.
His plots had some observations obscured by the y-axis!
</p>
<p>The DeLury method is not applicable to the data frame
<code>wffc.nc</code> since the 2008 World Fly Fishing Competition was
strictly catch-and-release.
