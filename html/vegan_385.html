<h2>Response of Aquatic Invertebrates to Insecticide Treatment</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The data are log transformed abundances of aquatic invertebrate in
twelve ditches studied in eleven times before and after an insecticide
treatment.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data(pyrifos)</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame with 132 observations on the log-transformed (<code>log(10*x + 1)</code>) abundances
of 178 species. There are only twelve sites (ditches, mesocosms), but
these were studied repeatedly in eleven occasions. The treatment
levels, treatment times, or ditch ID's are not in the data frame, but
the data are very regular, and the example below shows how to obtain
these external variables.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>  This data set was obtained from an experiment in outdoor
experimental ditches. Twelve mesocosms were allocated at random to
treatments; four served as controls, and the remaining eight were 
treated once with the insecticide chlorpyrifos, with nominal dose
levels of 0.1, 0.9, 6, and 44  <code class="reqn">\mu</code>g/ L in two mesocosms
each. The example data set invertebrates.
Sampling was done 11 times, from week -4 pre-treatment through
week 24 post-treatment, giving a total of 132 samples (12 mesocosms
times 11 sampling dates), see van den Brink &amp; ter Braak (1999) for
details. The data set contains only the species data,
but the example below shows how to obtain the treatment, time and
ditch ID variables.
