<h2> Confidence Intervals for Parameters of VGLMs </h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Computes confidence intervals (CIs)
for one or more parameters in a fitted model.
Currently the object must be a
<code>"vglm"</code> object.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">confintvglm(object, parm, level = 0.95, method = c("wald", "profile"),
            trace = NULL, ...)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>object</code></td>
<td>
<p> A fitted model object.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>parm, level, ...</code></td>
<td>
<p>Same as <code>confint</code>.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>method</code></td>
<td>
<p>Character.
The default is the first method.
Abbreviations are allowed.
Currently <code>"profile"</code> is basically working;
and it is likely to be more accurate especially for
small samples, as it is based on a profile log likelihood,
however it is computationally intensive.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>trace</code></td>
<td>

<p>Logical. If <code>TRUE</code> then one can monitor the
computation as it progresses (because it is expensive).
The default is the orginal model's <code>trace</code> value
(see <code>vglm.control</code>).
Setting <code>FALSE</code> suppresses all intermediate output.
</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The default for
this methods function is based on <code>confint.default</code>
and assumes
asymptotic normality. In particular,
the <code>coef</code> and
<code>vcov</code> methods functions are used for
<code>vglm-class</code> objects.
</p>
<p>When <code>method = "profile"</code> the function 
<code>profilevglm</code>
is called to do the profiling. The code is very heavily
based on <code>profile.glm</code>
which was originally written by
D. M. Bates and W. N. Venables (For S in 1996)
and subsequently corrected by B. D. Ripley.
Sometimes the profiling method can give problems, for
example, <code>cumulative</code> requires the <code class="reqn">M</code>
linear predictors not to intersect in the data cloud.
Such numerical problems are less common when
<code>method = "wald"</code>, however, it is well-known
that inference based on profile likelihoods is generally
more accurate than Wald, especially when the sample size
is small.
The deviance (<code>deviance(object)</code>) is used if possible,
else the difference
<code>2 * (logLik(object) - ell)</code> is computed,
where <code>ell</code> are the values of the loglikelihood on a grid.
</p>
<p>For
Wald CIs and
<code>rrvglm-class</code>
objects, currently an error message is produced because
I haven't gotten around to write the methods function;
it's not too hard, but am too busy!
An interim measure is to
coerce the object into a <code>"vglm"</code> object,
but then the confidence intervals will tend to be too narrow because
the estimated constraint matrices are treated as known.
</p>
<p>For
Wald CIs and
<code>vgam-class</code>
objects, currently an error message is produced because
the theory is undeveloped.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>Same as <code>confint</code>.
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>The order of the values of argument <code>method</code> may change
in the future without notice.
The functions
<code>plot.profile.glm</code>
and
<code>pairs.profile.glm</code>
from <span class="pkg">MASS</span>
appear to work with output from this function.
</p>






<h3>Author(s)</h3>

<p>Thomas Yee adapted <code>confint.lm</code>
to handle <code>"vglm"</code> objects, for Wald-type
confidence intervals.
Also, <code>profile.glm</code>
was originally written by
D. M. Bates and W. N. Venables (For S in 1996)
and subsequently corrected by B. D. Ripley.
This function effectively calls <code>confint.profile.glm()</code>
in <span class="pkg">MASS</span>.

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R"># Example 1: this is based on a glm example
counts &lt;- c(18,17,15,20,10,20,25,13,12)
outcome &lt;- gl(3, 1, 9); treatment &lt;- gl(3, 3)
 glm.D93 &lt;-  glm(counts ~ outcome + treatment, family = poisson())
vglm.D93 &lt;- vglm(counts ~ outcome + treatment, family = poissonff)
confint(glm.D93) # needs MASS to be present on the system
confint.default(glm.D93)  # based on asymptotic normality
confint(vglm.D93)
confint(vglm.D93) - confint(glm.D93)    # Should be all 0s
confint(vglm.D93) - confint.default(glm.D93)  # based on asympt. normality

# Example 2: simulated negative binomial data with multiple responses
ndata &lt;- data.frame(x2 = runif(nn &lt;- 100))
ndata &lt;- transform(ndata, y1 = rnbinom(nn, mu = exp(3+x2), size = exp(1)),
                          y2 = rnbinom(nn, mu = exp(2-x2), size = exp(0)))
fit1 &lt;- vglm(cbind(y1, y2) ~ x2, negbinomial, data = ndata, trace = TRUE)
coef(fit1)
coef(fit1, matrix = TRUE)
confint(fit1)
confint(fit1, "x2:1")  #  This might be improved to "x2" some day...
## Not run: 
confint(fit1, method = "profile")  # Computationally expensive
confint(fit1, "x2:1", method = "profile", trace = FALSE)

## End(Not run)

fit2 &lt;- rrvglm(y1 ~ x2, negbinomial(zero = NULL), data = ndata)
confint(as(fit2, "vglm"))  # Too narrow (SEs are biased downwards)
