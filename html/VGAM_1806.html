<h3>Details</h3>

<p>From Bickel et al. (1975),
the data consists of applications for admission to graduate
study at the University of California, Berkeley, for the
fall 1973 quarter.
In the admissions cycle for that quarter,
the Graduate Division at Berkeley received approximately
15,000 applications, some of which were later withdrawn or
transferred to a different proposed entry quarter by the
applicants.  Of the applications finally remaining for the
fall 1973 cycle 12,763 were sufficiently complete to permit
a decision.
There were about 101 graduate department and
interdepartmental graduate majors.  There were 8442 male
applicants and 4321 female applicants. About 44 percent of
the males and about 35 percent of the females were admitted.
The data are well-known for illustrating Simpson's paradox.
