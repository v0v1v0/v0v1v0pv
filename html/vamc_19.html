<h2>vamc: A package for pricing a pool of variable annuities.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The vamc package provides a Monte Carlo engine for valuating a pool of
variable annuities. The key steps are:
YieldCurveGeneration, ScenarioGeneration, PolicyGenerationl,
and MonteCarloValuation.
</p>


<h3>YieldCurveGeneration functions</h3>

<p>YieldCurveGeneration generates a forward curve from swap rates.
The forward curve is obtained by solving for swap rates that equates values of
floating and fixed notes.
</p>


<h3>ScenarioGeneration functions</h3>

<p>ScenarioGeneration generates a random fund scenario under Black-Scholes.
After simulating random index scenarios, a fundMap is used to allocate returns
of indices to each fund according to proportion of investment.
</p>


<h3>PolicyGenerationl functions</h3>

<p>PolicyGenerationl randomly generates a pool of variable annuities for
user-input birthday range, issue-date range, maturity range, account value range,
female percentage, fund management fee, fund base fee, product types,
rider fee of each type, roll-up-rate for roll-up featured guarantees,
withdrawal rate for GMWB, and number of policies to be generated for each type.
</p>


<h3>MonteCarloValuation functions</h3>

<p>MonteCarloValuation discounts cash flow from living and death benefits, as
well as risk charges for each policy in the portfolio.
