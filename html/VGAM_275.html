<h2>
Corbet's Butterfly Data

</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>About 3300 individual butterflies were caught in Malaya
by naturalist Corbet trapping butterflies.
They were classified to about 500 species.
</p>



<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data(corbet)</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame with 24 observations on the following 2 variables.
</p>

<dl>
<dt><code>species</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>Number of species. </p>
</dd>
<dt><code>ofreq</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>Observed frequency of individual
butterflies of that species. </p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>In the early 1940s Corbet spent two years trapping butterflies
in Malaya. Of interest was the total number of species.
Some species were so rare (e.g., 118 species had only
one specimen) that it was thought likely that there were
many unknown species.
</p>
<p>Actually, 119 species had over 24 observed frequencies,
so this could/should be appended to the data set.
Hence there are 620 species in total in a
sample size of <code class="reqn">n=9031</code> individuals.
</p>
