<h2>Class of Vector Generalized Linear Time Series Models</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p> Time series family functions for the <span class="pkg">VGAMextra</span> package</p>


<h3>Objects from the Class</h3>

<p>Objects can be created by calling 
<code>new("vgltsmff"...)</code>
</p>


<h3>slots</h3>

<p>Implementation of vector generalized linear time series (TS) family 
functions (<em>vgltsff</em>) at <span class="pkg">VGAMextra</span> is entirely based on 
the structure of family functions of the class 
<code>vglmff-class</code>.
</p>
<p>Hence, refer to <code>vglmff-class</code> for a 
thourugh description of slots and features involved when objects 
of class <code>"vgtsff"</code> are being created.
</p>


<h3>Methods</h3>

<p>Thus far, the following methods for objects of class
<code>"vgltsff-class"</code> are implemented:
</p>

<dl>
<dt><code>summary</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>Additional information to that displayed by the <code>summary</code>
methods from <span class="pkg">VGAM</span>. That is: 
</p>
<p>a) Standard errors  based on the MLEs asymptotic distributions, and
</p>
<p>b) Checks on stationarity and/or invertibility via the polynomial roots.
</p>
<p>Currently, summary methods at <span class="pkg">VGAMextra</span> have been 
implemented for:
</p>

<dl>
<dt>
<code>signature(VGAMff = "ARff")</code>:</dt>
<dd>
<p>For ARX–types family functions.</p>
</dd>
<dt>
<code>signature(VGAMff = "MAff")</code>:</dt>
<dd>  
<p>For MAX–types  family functions.</p>
</dd>
<dt>
<code>signature(VGAMff = "ARMAff")</code>:</dt>
<dd>  
<p>For ARMAX–like family functions.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>See 
<code>summaryS4VGAMextra</code>
for further details.

</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>Programmers to write VGAM/VGLM time series family functions are also
allowed to write methods functions either for specific purposes, or to 
extend those current methods to print some extra output required.
</p>
<p>In such cases, notice that the class <code>vgltsff-class</code> is 
<em>labeled</em> by an object of class <code>"character"</code> 
(a character vector) specified at the slot
<code>@vfamily</code> within the family function. This is, in fact, 
one of the required slots by the class 
<code>vglmff-class</code>.
</p>
<p>Additionally, practitioners are encouraged to mantain all previous 
conventions for naming the arguments in Ts family functions
as specified at
<code>vglmff-class</code>, e.g., 
<code>link</code> is the argument for parameter link functions, etc.
