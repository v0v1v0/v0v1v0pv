<h2>
Battle of Britain Data (a Luftwaffe subset)

</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Luftwaffe losses during a subset of the Battle of Britain.

</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data(bb.de)</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>The format is a <code class="reqn">3</code>-dimensional array.
The first dimension is the event
(in order:
shot down or failed to return,
written off,
seriously damaged),
the second dimension is the day,
the third is the aircraft type.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>


<p>This is a 
Battle of Britain data set of Luftwaffe losses during operations
26 August–31 August 1940 continued on to 1–7 September 1940.
The aircraft types are prefixed
<code>Bf</code> for Messerschmitt (Bayerische Flugzeugwerke),
<code>Do</code> for Dornier,
<code>He</code> for Heinkel,
<code>Ju</code> for Junkers.
</p>
<p>Note that p.151 and p.165 of Bowyer (1990)
contain tables (during the first week of September) and
almost the same data;
however, the former is labelled "shot down" whereas
the latter is "shot down or failed to return".
The latter is used here.
Also, there are some other small discrepancies.
</p>
<p>Yet to do: add the data available at other dates,
and include the RAF data.
