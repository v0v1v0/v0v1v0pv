<h2> Positive Bernoulli Family Function with Time Effects </h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Fits a GLM/GAM-like model to multiple Bernoulli responses where
each row in the capture history matrix response has at least one
success (capture).
Sampling occasion effects are accommodated.
</p>




<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">posbernoulli.t(link = "logitlink", parallel.t = FALSE ~ 1,
    iprob = NULL, p.small = 1e-4, no.warning = FALSE,
    type.fitted = c("probs", "onempall0"))
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>link, iprob, parallel.t</code></td>
<td>

<p>See <code>CommonVGAMffArguments</code> for information.
By default, the parallelism assumption does not apply to the
intercept.
Setting <code>parallel.t = FALSE ~ -1</code>,
or equivalently <code>parallel.t = FALSE ~ 0</code>,
results in the <code class="reqn">M_0</code>/<code class="reqn">M_h</code> model.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>p.small, no.warning</code></td>
<td>

<p>A small probability value used to give a warning for the
Horvitz–Thompson estimator.
Any estimated probability value less than <code>p.small</code> will
result in a warning, however, setting <code>no.warning = TRUE</code>
will suppress this warning if it occurs.
This is because the Horvitz-Thompson estimator is the sum of
the reciprocal of such probabilities, therefore any probability
that is too close to 0 will result in an unstable estimate.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>type.fitted</code></td>
<td>

<p>See <code>CommonVGAMffArguments</code> for information.
The default is to return a matrix of probabilities.
If <code>"onempall0"</code> is chosen then the
the probability that each animal is captured at least once
in the course of the study is returned.
The abbreviation stands for
one minus the probability of all 0s, and
the quantity appears in the denominator of the usual formula.

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>These models (commonly known as <code class="reqn">M_t</code> or <code class="reqn">M_{th}</code>
(no prefix <code class="reqn">h</code> means it is an intercept-only model)
in the capture–recapture literature) operate on a capture
history matrix response of 0s and 1s
(<code class="reqn">n \times \tau</code>).
Each column is a
sampling occasion where animals are potentially captured
(e.g., a field trip), and each row is an individual animal.
Capture is a 1, else a 0.  No removal of animals from
the population is made (closed population), e.g., no
immigration or emigration.  Each row of the response
matrix has at least one capture.
Once an animal is captured for the first time,
it is marked/tagged so that its future capture history can
be recorded.  Then it is released immediately back into the
population to remix.  It is released immediately after each
recapture too.  It is assumed that the animals are independent
and that, for a given animal, each sampling occasion is
independent.  And animals do not lose their marks/tags, and
all marks/tags are correctly recorded.
</p>
<p>The number of linear/additive predictors is equal to the number
of sampling occasions, i.e., <code class="reqn">M = \tau</code>, say.
The default link functions are
<code class="reqn">(logit \,p_{1},\ldots,logit \,p_{\tau})^T</code>
where each <code class="reqn">p_{j}</code> denotes the probability of capture at
time point <code class="reqn">j</code>.
The fitted value returned is a matrix of probabilities
of the same dimension as the response matrix.
</p>

<p>A conditional likelihood is maximized here using Fisher scoring.
Each sampling occasion has a separate probability that
is modelled here. The probabilities can be constrained
to be equal by setting <code>parallel.t = FALSE ~ 0</code>;
then the results are effectively the same as
<code>posbinomial</code> except the binomial constants are
not included in the log-likelihood.
If <code>parallel.t = TRUE ~ 0</code> then each column should have
at least one 1 and at least one 0.
</p>
<p>It is well-known that some species of animals are affected
by capture, e.g., trap-shy or trap-happy. This <span class="pkg">VGAM</span>
family function does <em>not</em> allow any behavioral effect to be
modelled (<code>posbernoulli.b</code>
and <code>posbernoulli.tb</code> do) because the
denominator of the likelihood function must be free of
behavioral effects.
</p>











<h3>Value</h3>

<p>An object of class <code>"vglmff"</code>
(see <code>vglmff-class</code>).
The object is used by modelling functions
such as <code>vglm</code>,
and <code>vgam</code>.
</p>
<p>Upon fitting the <code>extra</code> slot has a (list) component
called <code>N.hat</code>
which is a point estimate of the population size <code class="reqn">N</code>
(it is the Horvitz-Thompson (1952) estimator).
And there is a component called <code>SE.N.hat</code>
containing its standard error.
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>








<p>The <code>weights</code> argument of <code>vglm</code> need not be
assigned, and the default is just a matrix of ones.
</p>
<p>Fewer numerical problems are likely to occur
for <code>parallel.t = TRUE</code>.
Data-wise, each sampling occasion may need at least one success
(capture) and one failure.
Less stringent conditions in the data are needed when
<code>parallel.t = TRUE</code>.
Ditto when parallelism is applied to the intercept too.

</p>
<p>The response matrix is returned unchanged;
i.e., not converted into proportions like
<code>posbinomial</code>.  If the response matrix has column
names then these are used in the labelling, else <code>prob1</code>,
<code>prob2</code>, etc. are used.
</p>
<p>Using <code>AIC()</code> or <code>BIC()</code> to compare
<code>posbernoulli.t</code>,
<code>posbernoulli.b</code>,
<code>posbernoulli.tb</code>
models with a
<code>posbinomial</code>
model requires <code>posbinomial(omit.constant = TRUE)</code>
because one needs to remove the normalizing constant from the
log-likelihood function.
See <code>posbinomial</code> for an example.
