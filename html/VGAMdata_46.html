<h3>Details</h3>


<p>The European Central Banks (ECB) Eurosystem requests and
helps organize
each country within the European Union to routinely collect statistical
information via their central banks.
These data frames are a subset from data collected by the
Bank of Italy.
Each year can be considered a cross-sectional study, although
there are some people common to each year. Hence the data
collectively can be considered partly a longitudinal study too.
