<h2>Orthodont dataset from R-package 'nlme'</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The Orthodont data frame has 108 rows and 4 columns of the change in an orthdontic measurement over time for several young subjects. 
</p>
<p>This dataset was included to simplify its usage in automated unit-tests (see directory UnitTests) and examples. 
</p>
<p>Investigators at the University of North Carolina Dental School followed the growth of 27 children (16 males, 11 females) 
from age 8 until age 14. Every two years they measured the distance between the pituitary and the pterygomaxillary fissure, 
two points that are easily identified on x-ray exposures of the side of the head.
