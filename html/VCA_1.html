<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This package implements ANOVA-type estimation of variance components (VC) for linear mixed models (LMM), and provides 
Restricted Maximum Likelihood (REML) estimation incorporating functionality of the <code>lme4</code> package. For models fitted by REML
the typical VCA-table is derived, also containing the variances of VC, which are approximated by the method outlined in Giesbrecht &amp; Burns (1985). 
REML-estimation is available via functions <code>remlVCA</code> for variance component analysis (VCA) and <code>remlMM</code> for fitting
general LMM.
</p>
<p>ANOVA-methodology is a special method of moments approach for estimating (predicting) variance components implemented in functions
<code>anovaMM</code> and <code>anovaVCA</code>. The former represents a general, unrestricted approach to fitting
linear mixed models, whereas the latter is tailored for performing a VCA on random models.
Experiments of this type frequently occur in performance evaluation analyses of diagnostic tests or analyzers (devices)
quantifying various types of precision (see e.g. guideline EP05-A2/A3 of the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute - CLSI). 
</p>
<p>The general Satterthwaite approximation of denominator degrees of freedom for tests of fixed effects (<code>test.fixef</code>) and
LS Means (<code>test.lsmeans</code>) is implemented as used in SAS PROC MIXED.	Results differ for unbalanced designs because of the
different approaches to estimating the covariance matrix of variance components. Here, two algorithms are implemented for models fitted
via ANOVA, <code class="reqn">1^{st}</code> the "exact" method described in Searle et. al (1992), <code class="reqn">2^{nd}</code> an approximation described in Giesbrecht &amp; Burns (1985).
The latter is also used for models fitted by REML. See <code>test.fixef</code> and <code>getGB</code> for details on this topic.
</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Satterthwaite approximation of degrees of freedom for individual VCs and total variance is implemented. These are employed
in Chi-Squared tests of estimated variances against a claimed value (total, error), as well as in Chi-Squared based confidence intervals (CI) (see <code>VCAinference</code>). 
Whenever ANOVA-type estimated VCs become negative, the default is to set them equal to 0. ANOVA mean squares used within the Satterthwaite approximation
will be adapted to this situation by re-computing ANOVA mean squares (<code class="reqn">s_{MS}</code>) as <code class="reqn">s_{MS} = C * \sigma^{2 }</code>,
where <code class="reqn">C</code> is a coefficient matrix and a function of the design matrix and <code class="reqn">\sigma^{2}</code> is the column-vector of adapted variance components.
Total variance corresponds to a conservative estimate of the total variability in these cases, i.e. it will be larger than e.g. the total variance of the
same model fitted by REML, because the negative VC will not contribute to total variance. See the documentation <code>anovaVCA</code> and <code>anovaMM</code>
for details, specifically argument <code>NegVC</code>.
</p>
<p>Additionally to fitting linear mixed models and performing VCA-analyses, various plotting methods are implemented, e.g. a variability chart 
visualizing the variability in sub-classes emerging from an experimental design (<code>varPlot</code>). Random effects and residuals can be transformed 
and plotted using function <code>plotRandVar</code>. Standardization and studentization are generally available, Pearson-type transformation is only
available for residuals. Plotting (studentized) random variates of a LMM should always be done to reveal potential problems of the fitted model, e.g. 
violation of model assumptions and/or whether there are outlying observations.<br></p>
<p>There are not any more two approaches to estimating ANOVA sums (SSQ) of squares as in previous package-versions. Now, only a fast FORTRAN-routine is used generating
the column vector of SSQ, coefficient matrix C (previously computed using the Abbreviated Doolittle and Square Root Method), and the covariance matrix of VC.
Overall, this leads to a dramatic reduction of computation time for models fitted using ANOVA.
</p>
<p>Further reduction of the computation time can be achieved using Intel's <code>Math Kernel Library (MKL)</code>. When the package is loaded it will be automatically
checked whether this is the case or not.
</p>
<p>In LS Means computation of fitted LMM it is possible to compute LS Means using specific values of covariables, which is equivalent to using option 'AT' in 
the 'lsmeans'-statement of SAS PROC MIXED. It is also possible to apply other than the default weighting scheme for (fixed) factor-variables. See the details section
in <code>lsmeans</code> and the description of argument <code>at</code>.
</p>
<p>Note: The 'UnitTests' directory within the package-directory contains a pre-defined test-suite which can be run by sourcing
'RunAllTests.R' for user side testing (installation verification). It requires the 'RUnit' package and checks the numerical
equivalence to reference results (SAS PROC MIXED method=type1/reml, SAS PROC VARCOMP) for balanced and unbalanced data and different experimental designs.</p>
