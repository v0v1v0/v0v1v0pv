<h2>
Variable Selection with Mixture of Models
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Two methods are implemented to cluster data with finite mixture
    regression models. Those procedures deal with high-dimensional covariates and
    responses through a variable selection procedure based on the Lasso estimator.
    A low-rank constraint could be added, computed for the Lasso-Rank procedure.
    A collection of models is constructed, varying the level of sparsity and the
    number of clusters, and a model is selected using a model selection criterion
    (slope heuristic, BIC or AIC). Details of the procedure are provided in
    "Model-based clustering for high-dimensional data. Application to functional data"
    by Emilie Devijver (2016) &lt;arXiv:1409.1333v2&gt;,
    published in Advances in Data Analysis and Clustering.

<p>The main function is runValse(), which calls all other functions.
See also plot_valse() which plots the relevant parameters after a run.
