<h2>VarReg: Semi-parametric mean and variance regression</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Methods for fitting semi-parametric mean and variance models, with normal or censored data.
Also extended to allow a regression in the location, scale and shape parameters.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This package provides functions to fit semi-parametric mean and variance regression models. These models
are based upon EM-type algorithms, which can have more stable convergence properties than other
algorithms for additive variance regression models.
</p>
<p>The primary function to use for linear and semi-parametric mean and variance models is <code>semiVarReg</code>.
This function also is able to fit models to censored outcome data. There is also a plot function for these
models called <code>plotVarReg</code>.
A search function has also been produced in order to assist users to find the optimal number of knots in
the model (<code>searchVarReg</code>).
</p>
<p>The other functions that are of particular use are <code>lssVarReg</code> and its plot function
<code>plotlssVarReg</code>. This uses the skew-normal distribution and combines the EM algorithm with
a coordinate-ascent type algorithm in order to fit a regression model in the location, scale and shape,
therefore extending the semi-parametric models to non-normal data.
</p>
<p>Multivariate models can be fit with <code>semiVarReg.multi</code> and <code>lssVarReg.multi</code>
