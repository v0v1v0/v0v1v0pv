<h2>Calculates bias in flooding duration estimates due to logger deployment time</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Seasonality in water levels imparts  bias to flooding duration 
datasets built from short-term water level data. <code>dur.bias</code> calculates 
and presents these biases in visual and tabular form.
</p>
<p>Using data from a nearby, user-defined NOAA station, bias is estimated by comparing the 
relationship between flooding duration and elevation in datasets covering two time periods: 
(1) the time periodof water level logger deployment, and (2) the reference time period 
(some number of years).
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">dur.bias(
  data,
  dateCol = 1,
  station = 8518750,
  ref.period = c("20120101", "20121231"),
  time = "GMT"
)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>data</code></td>
<td>
<p>water level dataset. must have a time stamp column named 'datetime' with the first ten 
digits following the format <code>YYYY-MM-DD</code>.Different separators are fine, but the 
placement and number of digits for year, month, and day are critical. Date range 
must be continuous, or the "estimated" curve won't be accurate (datasets with gaps won't 
work well)</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>dateCol</code></td>
<td>
<p>index number of the column in 'data' containing dates. Must be a date/POSIX datatype.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>station</code></td>
<td>
<p>name or number of NOAA station to be used for reference data. Ideally, 
use the station closest to where your water level data was collected. This is fed 
to <code>noaa</code> so must be compatible with <code>noaa</code>'s <code>station</code> argument.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>ref.period</code></td>
<td>
<p>downloads NOAA tide data to set reference flooding-elevation relationship. This 
is used to evaluate accuracy of flooding duration estimates determined by water level 
deployment. Use of whole years is recommended. dates must be entered in format 
<code>YYYYMMDD</code>, in the form <code>(c(start_date, end_date))</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>time</code></td>
<td>
<p>time zone to download reference data (<code>GMT</code> is default; the NOAA website 
does not have all data available in all time zones.)</p>
</td>
</tr>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Seasonality in water levels imparts  bias to flooding duration datasets 
built from short-term water level data. <code>dur.bias</code> calculates and presents 
these biases in visual and tabular form.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>(1) A summary of root mean square errors is printed, 
(2) a data frame of elevations, flooding duration estimates, and their associated bias 
estimates is saved as output, and (3) two plots are made, graphically showing the 
relationship between predicted and reference flooding duration curves.
