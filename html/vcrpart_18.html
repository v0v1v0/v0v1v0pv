<h2>Special terms for formulas.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Special terms for formulas assigned to <code>tvcm</code>,
<code>fvcm</code> and <code>olmm</code>.   
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">fe(formula, intercept = TRUE)
re(formula, intercept = TRUE)
vc(..., by, intercept = missing(by), nuisance = character())
ce(formula)
ge(formula)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>formula</code></td>
<td>
<p>a symbolic description for the corresponding component
of the formula component. See examples.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>intercept</code></td>
<td>
<p>logical or character vector. <code>intercept = TRUE</code>
(default) indicates that an intercept is incorporated.
<code>intercept = FALSE</code> removes the random intercept from the
formula. Note that the sometimes allowed <code>-1</code>
term is ignored. The character strings <code>"ce"</code>
(category-specific random intercepts) and <code>"ge"</code>
(category-global random intercepts) may be used in connection with
<code>olmm</code>. Intercepts have specific interpretations for
<code>fe</code>, <code>re</code> and <code>vc</code>, see the details.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>...</code></td>
<td>
<p>the names of variables that moderate (i.e. modify) the
effects of the variables specified in <code>by</code>, separated by
commas. It is also possibly to assign a vector that contains the
variable names as characters. Note that operators like
<code>factor(x)</code> are not allowed.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>by</code></td>
<td>
<p>a formula of predictors the effects of which are moderated
by the variables in <code>...</code>. See <code>tvcm</code> and the
examples below. Note that the <code>by</code> variable must be numeric and
factor variables must be recoded to dummy variables by hand.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>nuisance</code></td>
<td>
<p>character vector of variables in <code>by</code> which have
to be estimated separately for each partition but the algorithm should
not focus on this variable when searching for splits.</p>
</td>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Special formula terms to define fixed effects <code>fe</code>,
varying coefficients <code>vc</code> and random effects
<code>re</code>. The use of these formula terms ensures that
the functions <code>fvcm</code>, <code>tvcm</code> and
<code>olmm</code> fit the intended model. Some examples are given
below and on the documentation pages of the fitting functions.
</p>
<p>For all of <code>fvcm</code>, <code>tvcm</code> and
<code>olmm</code>, variables which are not defined with one of
<code>fe</code>, <code>vc</code> and <code>re</code> are
treated as fixed effects. Intercepts can be dropped from the model by
the <code>intercept</code> argument. The terms <code>ce</code>
(category-specific effects) and <code>ge</code> (global effect or
proportional odds effect) are designed for the function
<code>olmm</code>. Notice that <code>tvcm</code> may changes,
for internal reasons, the order of the terms in the specified
formula. Note that you can put multiple terms within
<code>fe</code>, <code>ge</code> and <code>ce</code> terms
(e.g., <code>fe(ce(x1 + x2 + ge(x3 + x4))</code>).
</p>
<p>At present, the term <code>"."</code>, which is often use to extract all
variables of the data, is ignored. As an alternative,
<code>vc</code> interprets character vectors, assigned as unnamed
arguments, as lists of variables of moderators to be extracted from
<code>data</code>. See the examples below.
</p>
<p>Default for intercepts in <code>fe</code> terms is <code>intercept
    = TRUE</code>, or <code>intercept = "ce"</code> for models fitted with
<code>olmm</code>. This means that an intercept is automatically
attached. Alternatives are <code>intercept = FALSE</code>, which is equal to
<code>intercept = "none"</code>, and <code>intercept = "ge"</code>, which yields a
global-effect intercept for models fitted with <code>olmm</code>.
</p>
<p>Default for intercepts in <code>vc</code> is to introduce an
intercept if the <code>by</code> argument is ignored, otherwise no intercept
is introduced. Specifically, if input is specified for the <code>by</code>
argument, then  <code>intercept = TRUE</code>, or <code>intercept = "ce"</code>
for models fitted by <code>olmm</code>. Alternatives are
<code>intercept = FALSE</code>, which is equal to <code>intercept = "none"</code>,
and <code>intercept = "ge"</code>, which yields a global-effect varying
intercept. 
</p>
<p>Default for intercepts in <code>re</code> is <code>intercept =
  TRUE</code>, which is equal to <code>intercept = "ge"</code>. <code>intercept =
  FALSE</code> is equal to <code>intercept = "none"</code>. For category-specific
random intercepts, use <code>intercept = "ge"</code>. See
<code>olmm</code>. 
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<code>olmm</code> for constructing the model matrices.

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">## Formula for a model with 2 fixed effects (x1 and x2) and a random
## intercept. The 're' terms indicates that an intercept is fitted for
## each level of 'id'.

formula &lt;- y ~ fe(x1 + x2) + re(1|id)

## Formula for a model with one fixed effect and one varying coefficient
## term with 2 moderators and 2 varying coefficient predictors. 'tvcm'
## will fit one partition to model the effects of 'x2' and 'x3' as
## functions of 'z1' and 'z2'.

formula &lt;- y ~ x1 + vc(z1, z2, by = x2 + x3, intercept = TRUE)

## Similar formula as above, but the predictors 'x2' and 'x3' have
## separate 'vc' terms. 'tvcm' will fit a separate partition for each of
## 'x2' and 'x3' to model their effects as functions of 'z1' and 'z2'.

formula &lt;- y ~ x1 + vc(z1, z2, by = x2) + vc(z1, z2, by = x3)

## As an alternative to '.' you can define variables in a vector
vars &lt;- c("x1", "x2", "x3")
formula &lt;- y ~ x1 + vc(vars, by = x2) + vc(vars, by = x3)
