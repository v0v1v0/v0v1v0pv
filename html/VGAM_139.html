<h2> Calibration for CQO and CAO models </h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Performs maximum likelihood calibration
for constrained
quadratic and additive ordination models (CQO and CAO
models are better known as QRR-VGLMs and RR-VGAMs respectively).
</p>



<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">calibrate.qrrvglm(object, newdata = NULL,
    type = c("latvar", "predictors", "response", "vcov", "everything"),
    lr.confint = FALSE, cf.confint = FALSE,
    level = 0.95, initial.vals = NULL, ...)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>object</code></td>
<td>
<p> The fitted CQO/CAO model.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>newdata</code></td>
<td>
<p> A data frame with new response data,
such as new species data.
The default is to use the original data used to fit the model;
however, the calibration may take a long time to compute
because the computations are expensive.
</p>

<p>Note that the creation of the model frame associated with
<code>newdata</code> is fragile. Factors may not be created
properly. If a variable is binary then its best for it
to be straightforward and have only 0 and 1 as values.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>type</code></td>
<td>
<p> What type of result to be returned.
The first are the calibrated latent variables or site scores.
This is always computed.
The <code>"predictors"</code> are the linear/quadratic or additive
predictors evaluated at the calibrated latent variables or site
scores.
The <code>"response"</code> are the fitted values (usually means)
evaluated at the
calibrated latent variables or site scores.
The <code>"vcov"</code> are the Wald-type estimated variance-covariance
matrices of the
calibrated latent variables or site scores.
The <code>"everything"</code> is for all of them, i.e., all <code>type</code>s.
Note that for CAO models,
the <code>"vcov"</code> type is unavailable.

<p>Compute <em>approximate</em>
likelihood ratio based confidence intervals?
If <code>TRUE</code> then <code>level</code> is the confidence level required
and one should have <code>type = "latvar"</code>
or <code>type = "everything"</code>;
and currently only rank-1 models are supported.
This option works for CLO and CQO models and not for CAO models.
The function <code>uniroot</code> is called to solve for
the root of a nonlinear equation to obtain each confidence limit,
and this is not entirely reliable.
It is assumed that the likelihood function is unimodal
about its MLE
because only one root is returned if there is more than one.
One root is found on each side of the MLE.
Technically, the default is to find the value of the latent
variable whose difference in deviance (or twice the difference
in log-likelihoods) from the optimal model
is equal to <code>qchisq(level, df = 1)</code>.
The intervals are not true profile likelihood intervals
because it is not possible to estimate the regression coefficients
of the QRR-VGLM/RR-VGLM based on one response vector.
See <code>confint</code> to get the flavour of these two
arguments in general.

Technically, the CDF of a normalized score statistic is
obtained by Gauss–Hermite numerical integration of a
complex-valued integrand,
and this is based on the inversion formula described in
Abate and Witt (1992).

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Given a fitted regression CQO/CAO model,
maximum likelihood calibration is theoretically easy and elegant.
However, the method assumes that all the responses are
independent, which is often not true in practice.
More details and references are given in Yee (2018) and
ch.6 of Yee (2015).
</p>
<p>The function <code>optim</code> is used to search for
the maximum likelihood solution. Good initial values are
needed, and arguments in <code>calibrate.qrrvglm.control</code>
allows the user some control over the choice of these.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>Several methods are implemented to obtain
confidence intervals/regions for the calibration estimates.
One method is when <code>lr.confint = TRUE</code>,
then a 4-column matrix is returned
with the confidence limits being the final 2 columns
(if <code>type = "everything"</code> then the matrix is
returned in the <code>lr.confint</code> list component).
Another similar method is when <code>cf.confint = TRUE</code>.
There may be some redundancy in whatever is returned.
Other methods are returned by using <code>type</code> 
and they are described as follows.
</p>

<p>The argument <code>type</code> determines what is returned.
If <code>type = "everything"</code> then all the <code>type</code> values
are returned in a list, with the following components.
Each component has length <code>nrow(newdata)</code>.
</p>
<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>latvar</code></td>
<td>
<p>Calibrated latent variables or site scores
(the default).
This may have the attribute <code>"objectiveFunction"</code>
which is usually the log-likelihood or the deviance.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>predictors </code></td>
<td>
<p>linear/quadratic or additive predictors.
For example, for Poisson families, this will be on a log scale,
and for binomial families, this will be on a logit scale.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>response</code></td>
<td>
<p>Fitted values of the response, evaluated at the
calibrated latent variables.
</p>

</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>vcov</code></td>
<td>
<p>Wald-type estimated variance-covariance matrices of the
calibrated latent variables or site scores.  Actually,
these are stored in a 3-D array whose dimension is
<code>c(Rank(object), Rank(object), nrow(newdata))</code>.
This type has only been implemented for
<code>binomialff</code> and <code>poissonff</code> models
with canonical links and <code>noRRR = ~ 1</code> and,
for CQOs, <code>I.tolerances = TRUE</code> or <code>eq.tolerances = TRUE</code>.
</p>

<h3>Warning </h3>

<p>This function is computationally expensive.
Setting <code>trace = TRUE</code> to get a running log can be a good idea.
This function has been tested but not extensively.
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>Despite the name of this function, CAO models are handled as well
to a certain extent.
Some combinations of parameters are not handled, e.g.,
<code>lr.confint = TRUE</code> only works for rank-1,
<code>type = "vcov"</code> only works for
<code>binomialff</code> and <code>poissonff</code>
models with canonical links and <code>noRRR = ~ 1</code>,
and higher-order rank models need
<code>eq.tolerances = TRUE</code> or <code>I.tolerances = TRUE</code>
as well.
For rank-1 objects, <code>lr.confint = TRUE</code> is recommended
above <code>type = "vcov"</code> in terms of accuracy and overall generality.
For class <code>"qrrvglm"</code> objects it is necessary that
all response' tolerance matrices are positive-definite
which correspond to bell-shaped response curves/surfaces.
</p>
<p>For <code>binomialff</code> and <code>poissonff</code> models
the <code>deviance</code> slot is used for the optimization rather than
the <code>loglikelihood</code> slot, therefore one can calibrate using
real-valued responses. (If the <code>loglikelihood</code> slot were used
then functions such as <code>dpois</code> would be used
with <code>log = TRUE</code> and then would be restricted to feed in
integer-valued response values.)
</p>

<p>Maximum likelihood calibration for
Gaussian logit regression models may be performed by
<span class="pkg">rioja</span> but this applies to a single environmental variable
such as <code>pH</code> in <code>data("SWAP", package = "rioja")</code>.
In <span class="pkg">VGAM</span> <code>calibrate()</code> estimates values of the
<em>latent variable</em> rather than individual explanatory variables,
hence the setting is more on ordination.
