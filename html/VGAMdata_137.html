<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This type of data is very subjective because many
definitions cannot ever be finalized.
The Wiki website was written by an anonymous person
and the data collected informally and there is no
quality assurance.
Of course, it could be debated as whether a particular person
should be included.
And there will be many people who should be there but
are not.
Nevertheless, it can be considered a fun data set 
that should be of interest to anybody liking
modern music or
the history of such in musicology.
</p>
<p>In the source, some peoples' ages were listed as a
decade, e.g., age was <code>40s</code> or <code>50--51</code>.
These were either replaced by <code>NA</code> or the mean
of the endpoints was taken.
