<h2>Residuals for a VGLM fit</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Residuals for a vector generalized linear model (VGLM)
object.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">residualsvglm(object, type = c("working", "pearson", "response",
   "deviance", "ldot", "stdres", "rquantile"), matrix.arg = TRUE)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>object</code></td>
<td>

<p>Object of class <code>"vglm"</code>,
i.e., a <code>vglm</code> fit.
</p>
</td>

<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>type</code></td>
<td>

<p>The value of this argument can be abbreviated.
The type of residuals to be returned.
The default is the first one: working residuals
corresponding to
the IRLS algorithm. These are defined for all models.
They are sometimes added to VGAM plots of estimated
component functions (see <code>plotvgam</code>).
</p>
<p>Pearson residuals for GLMs, when squared and summed over the
data set, total to the Pearson chi-squared statistic.
For VGLMs, Pearson residuals involve the working weight
matrices and the score vectors. Under certain limiting
conditions, Pearson residuals have 0 means and identity
matrix as the variance-covariance matrix.
</p>
<p>Response residuals are simply the difference between
the observed values and the fitted values. Both have
to be of the same dimension, hence not all families have
response residuals defined.
</p>
<p>Deviance residuals are only defined for models with
a deviance function. They tend to GLMs mainly.
This function returns a <code>NULL</code> for those models
whose deviance is undefined.
</p>
<p>Randomized quantile residuals (RQRs)
(Dunn and Smyth, 1996)
are based on
the <code>p</code>-type function being fed into
<code>qnorm</code>.
For example, for the default <code>exponential</code>
it is <code>qnorm(pexp(y, rate = 1 / fitted(object)))</code>.
So one should expect these residuals to have a
standard normal distribution if the model and data agree well.
If the distribution is discrete then <em>randomized</em>
values are returned; see
<code>runif</code> and
<code>set.seed</code>.
For example, for the default <code>poissonff</code>
it is
<code>qnorm(runif(length(y), ppois(y - 1, mu), ppois(y, mu)))</code>
where <code>mu</code> is the fitted mean.
The following excerpts comes from their writings.
They highly recommend quantile residuals for
discrete distributions
since plots
using deviance and Pearson residuals may contain
distracting patterns.
Four replications of the quantile residuals are recommended
with discrete distributions because they
have a random component.
Any features not preserved across all four sets
of residuals are considered artifacts of the randomization.
This type of residual is continuous even for
discrete distributions;
for both discrete and continuous distributions,
the quantile residuals have an exact standard normal
distribution.
</p>








<p>The choice <code>"ldot"</code> should not be used currently.
</p>
<p>Standardized residuals are currently
only defined for 2 types of models:
(i) GLMs
(<code>poissonff</code>,
<code>binomialff</code>);
(ii) those fitted
to a two-way table of counts, e.g.,
<code>cumulative</code>,
<code>acat</code>,
<code>multinomial</code>,
<code>sratio</code>,
<code>cratio</code>.
For (ii),
they are defined in Section 2.4.5 of Agresti (2018)
and are also the output from the <code>"stdres"</code> component
of <code>chisq.test</code>.
For the test of independence
they are a useful type of residual.
Their formula is
<code>(observed - expected) / sqrt(V)</code>, where <code>V</code> is
the residual cell variance
(also see Agresti, 2007, section 2.4.5).
When an independence null hypothesis is true, each
standardized residual (corresponding to a cell in the table)
has a a large-sample standard normal distribution.
Currently this function merely extracts the table of counts
from <code>object</code>
and then computes the standardized residuals like 
<code>chisq.test</code>.

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This function returns various kinds of residuals,
sometimes depending on the specific type of
model having been fitted.
Section 3.7 of Yee (2015) gives some details on
several types of residuals defined for the VGLM class.
</p>
<p>Standardized residuals for GLMs are described in
Section 4.5.6 of Agresti (2013) as the ratio of
the raw (response) residuals divided by their
standard error.
They involve the generalized hat matrix evaluated
at the final IRLS iteration.
When applied to the LM,
standardized residuals for GLMs simplify to
<code>rstandard</code>.
For GLMs they are basically 
the Pearson residual divided by the square root of 1 minus the 
leverage.
</p>






<h3>Value</h3>

<p>If that residual type is undefined or inappropriate
or not yet implemented,
then <code>NULL</code> is returned,
otherwise a matrix or vector of residuals is returned.
</p>


<h3>Warning </h3>

<p>This function may change in the future, especially
those whose definitions may change.
