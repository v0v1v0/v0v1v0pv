<h2>Permutation Test for Constrained Correspondence Analysis,
Redundancy Analysis and Constrained Analysis of Principal Coordinates </h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The function performs an ANOVA like permutation test for Constrained
Correspondence Analysis (<code>cca</code>), Redundancy Analysis
(<code>rda</code>) or distance-based Redundancy Analysis (dbRDA,
<code>dbrda</code>) to assess the significance of constraints.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">## S3 method for class 'cca'
anova(object, ..., permutations = how(nperm=999),
     by = NULL, model = c("reduced", "direct", "full"),
     parallel = getOption("mc.cores"), strata = NULL,
     cutoff = 1, scope = NULL)
## S3 method for class 'cca'
permutest(x, permutations = how(nperm = 99),
     model = c("reduced", "direct", "full"), by = NULL, first = FALSE,
     strata = NULL, parallel = getOption("mc.cores"), ...)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>object</code></td>
<td>
<p>One or several result objects from <code>cca</code>,
<code>rda</code>, <code>dbrda</code> or <code>capscale</code>. If
there are several result objects, they are compared against each
other in the order they were supplied. For a single object, a test
specified in <code>by</code> or an overall test is given.</p>
</td>

<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>x</code></td>
<td>
<p>A single ordination result object.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>permutations</code></td>
<td>
<p>a list of control values for the permutations
as returned by the function <code>how</code>, or the
number of permutations required, or a permutation matrix where each
row gives the permuted indices.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>by</code></td>
<td>
<p>Setting <code>by = "axis"</code> will assess significance for
each constrained axis, and setting <code>by = "terms"</code> will assess
significance for each term (sequentially from first to last), and
setting <code>by = "margin"</code> will assess the marginal effects of
the terms (each marginal term analysed in a model with all other
variables), and <code>by = "onedf"</code> will assess sequentially
one-degree-of-freedom contrasts of split factors.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>model</code></td>
<td>
<p>Permutation model: <code>model="direct"</code> permutes
community data, <code>model="reduced"</code> permutes residuals
of the community data after Conditions (partial model),
<code>model = "full"</code> permutes residuals after Conditions and
Constraints.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>parallel</code></td>
<td>
<p>Use parallel processing with the given number of
cores.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>strata</code></td>
<td>
<p>An integer vector or factor specifying the strata for
permutation. If supplied, observations are permuted only within
the specified strata. It is an error to use this when
<code>permutations</code> is a matrix, or a <code>how</code>
defines <code>blocks</code>. This is a legacy argument that will be
deprecated in the future: use
<code>permutations = how(..., blocks)</code> instead. </p>

<td>
<p>Only effective with <code>by="axis"</code> where stops
permutations after an axis equals or exceeds the <code>cutoff</code>
<code class="reqn">p</code>-value.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>scope</code></td>
<td>
<p>Only effective with <code>by="margin"</code> where it can be
used to select the marginal terms for testing. The default is to
test all marginal terms in <code>drop.scope</code>.</p>

<td>
<p>Parameters passed to other functions.  <code>anova.cca</code>
passes all arguments to <code>permutest.cca</code>. In <code>anova</code> with
<code>by = "axis"</code> you can use argument <code>cutoff</code> (defaults
<code>1</code>) which stops permutations after exceeding the given

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Functions <code>anova.cca</code> and <code>permutest.cca</code> implement ANOVA
like permutation tests for the joint effect of constraints in
<code>cca</code>, <code>rda</code>, <code>dbrda</code> or
<code>capscale</code>. Function <code>anova</code> is intended as a more
user-friendly alternative to <code>permutest</code> (that is the real
workhorse).
</p>
<p>Function <code>anova</code> can analyse a sequence of constrained
ordination models. The analysis is based on the differences in
residual deviance in permutations of nested models.
</p>
<p>The default test is for the sum of all constrained eigenvalues.
Setting <code>first = TRUE</code> will perform a test for the first
constrained eigenvalue.  Argument <code>first</code> can be set either in
<code>anova.cca</code> or in <code>permutest.cca</code>.  It is also possible to
perform significance tests for each axis or for each term
(constraining variable) using argument <code>by</code> in <code>anova.cca</code>.
Setting <code>by = "axis"</code> will perform separate significance tests
for each constrained axis.  All previous constrained axes will be used
as conditions (“partialled out”) and a test for the first
constrained eigenvalues is performed (Legendre et al. 2011).  You can
stop permutation tests after exceeding a given significance level with
argument <code>cutoff</code> to speed up calculations in large
models. Setting <code>by = "terms"</code> will perform separate significance
test for each term (constraining variable). The terms are assessed
sequentially from first to last, and the order of the terms will
influence their significances. Setting <code>by = "onedf"</code> will
perform a similar sequential test for one-degree-of-freedom effects,
where multi-level factors are split in their contrasts. Setting
<code>by = "margin"</code> will perform separate significance test for each
marginal term in a model with all other terms. The marginal test also
accepts a <code>scope</code> argument for the <code>drop.scope</code> which
can be a character vector of term labels that are analysed, or a
fitted model of lower scope.  The marginal effects are also known as
“Type III” effects, but the current function only evaluates
marginal terms. It will, for instance, ignore main effects that are
included in interaction terms. In calculating pseudo-<code class="reqn">F</code>, all
terms are compared to the same residual of the full model.
</p>
<p>Community data are permuted with choice <code>model="direct"</code>, and
residuals after partial CCA/ RDA/ dbRDA with choice
<code>model="reduced"</code> (default).  If there is no partial CCA/ RDA/
dbRDA stage, <code>model="reduced"</code> simply permutes the data and is
equivalent to <code>model="direct"</code>.  The test statistic is
“pseudo-<code class="reqn">F</code>”, which is the ratio of constrained and
unconstrained total Inertia (Chi-squares, variances or something
similar), each divided by their respective degrees of freedom.  If
there are no conditions (“partial” terms), the sum of all
eigenvalues remains constant, so that pseudo-<code class="reqn">F</code> and eigenvalues
would give equal results.  In partial CCA/ RDA/ dbRDA, the effect of
conditioning variables (“covariables”) is removed before
permutation, and the total Chi-square is not fixed, and test based on
pseudo-<code class="reqn">F</code> would differ from the test based on plain
eigenvalues.

<h3>Value</h3>

<p>The function <code>anova.cca</code> calls <code>permutest.cca</code> and fills an
<code>anova</code> table. Additional attributes are
<code>Random.seed</code> (the random seeds used),
<code>control</code> (the permutation design, see how) and
<code>F.perm</code> (the permuted test statistics).
