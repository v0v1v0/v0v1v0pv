<h2>Retrieve the Estimated Vaccine Efficacy</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Uses a prior veWaningVariant() analysis to estimate the vaccine efficacy
at the provided times since full efficacy.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">ve(x, times = NULL, nTimes = 20L)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>x</code></td>
<td>
<p>An object of class VEwaningVariant. The object returned by a call to
veWaningVariant()</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>times</code></td>
<td>
<p>A numeric vector object or NULL. The times since full
efficacy at which the vaccine efficacy is to be estimated. If NULL, the
times will be generated internally as a vector of length nTimes spanning
the range [0, maxTime], where maxTime is the maximum time since vaccination  
present in the original analysis. Values provided outside of [0, maxTime] 
are ignored.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>nTimes</code></td>
<td>
<p>An integer object. The number of time values at which
estimates are obtained. The default is 20. If input times is a vector
object, this input is ignored.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>When the variant under analysis is present only in the unblinded phase, 
vaccine efficacy cannot be estimated. In this case, ve() returns the  
relative infection rate at times t since full efficacy reached, defined  
as infection rate at time t = time since full efficacy reached  
divided by the infection rate at the time full efficacy is reached (t=0).
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A matrix object. The first column contains the times since
full efficacy at which the estimates are provided; the second column
contains estimated vaccine efficacy or relative infection rate 
(see Details); and the third is the standard error.
</p>


<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">

data(variantData)

set.seed(1234)

ind &lt;- sample(1:nrow(variantData), 2000)
# NOTE: This sample size is chosen for example only -- larger data sets
# should be used.

res &lt;- veWaningVariant(data = variantData[ind,], 
                       L = 52,  
                       gFunc = 'piece', 
                       v = c(15,30))

ve(x = res, times = c(10,20,30,40,50))
