<h2>Inermediate Precision Data from CLSI EP05-A3</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This data set consists of the Glucose intermediate precision data in the CLSI
EP05-A3 guideline, i.e. total variance for a fully-nested design with 3 variance components (day, run, error).<br>
Note, that the results in the original EP05-A3 guideline were obtained using rounded intermediate results, whereas,
package <code>VCA</code> uses full precision. Any differences between results listed in the CLSI EP05-A3 guideline
and those generated by the package are due to error propagation in the working example presented in the CLSI guideline. 
Here, full precision is used for all intermediate results.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data(Glucose)</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>data.frame with 80 rows and 3 variables.</p>
