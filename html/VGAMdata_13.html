<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A prospective data set containing the DMFT index of children in
Belo Horizonte at the beginning and end of the BELCAP study.
</p>



<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data(belcap)</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame with 797 observations on the following 5 variables.
</p>

<dl>
<dt><code>dmftb</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>a numeric vector, DMFT-Index at the beginning of the study.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>dmfte</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>a numeric vector, DMFT-Index at the end of the study.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>gender</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>a factor with levels <code>0</code> = female, <code>1</code> = male.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>ethnic</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>a factor with levels <code>1</code> = dark, <code>2</code> = white,

</dd>
<dt><code>school</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>the kind of prevention measure.
A factor with levels <code>1</code> = 
oral health education, <code>2</code> = all four methods, <code>3</code> = control group, 
<code>4</code> = enrichment of the school diet with ricebran, <code>5</code> = mouthrinse 
with 0.2% NaF-solution, <code>6</code> = oral hygiene.</p>

</dl>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This data set is from the Belo Horizonte Caries Prevention (BELCAP) study. The
data is collected from children in Belo Horizonte (Brazil) aged seven years at 
the start of the study. In in order to determine which method(s) were best for 
preventing tooth decay, six treatments were randomized to six separate schools.
The measure used is the decayed, missing and filled teeth (DMFT) index - a well
known and important measure of a persons dental health. Only the eight deciduous
molars are considered, so the lowest value is 0, and the highest is 8.
