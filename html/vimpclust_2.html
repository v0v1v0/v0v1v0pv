<h2>Mice Protein Expression Data Set</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The data set consists of the expression levels of 68 proteins that produced detectable signal in the nuclear fraction of 
cortex for a sample of 72 mice. There are 38 control mice and 34 trisomic mice. Several measurements were recorded for each protein
and for each mouse. The measurements containing missing observations in the original data were suppressed, so that one has between
12 and 15 measurements per protein and per mouse. 
</p>
<p>Mice may be further described based on the treatment they received (injected with memantine or saline), and on their behaviour 
(stimulated to learn or not).

<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame of 72 rows (mice) and 905 columns (variables):
</p>


<h3>Fields</h3>


<dl>
<dt><code>Protein_X_meas_Y</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>Numerical. The expression level for protein X at measurement Y. X has values between 1 and 68, Y has values
between 1 and 12 or 15, according to the number of measurements.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>Genotype</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>Categorical. Two values: "Control" and "Ts65Dn" (trisomic mouse).</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>Treatment</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>Categorical. Two values: "Memantine" and "Saline".</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>Behaviour</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>Categorical. Two values: "C/S" (stimulated to learn) and "S/C" (not stimulated to learn).</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>Class.mouse</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>Categorical. This variables creates eight classes of mice, based on crossing the categories of <code>Genotype</code>,
<code>Behaviour</code> and <code>Treatment</code>.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>MouseID</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>Factor. The key variable identifying each mouse in the sample.</p>
