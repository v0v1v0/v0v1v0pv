<h2>Plot Excluded Observations with Reasons for Exclusion</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function generates a ggplot2 visualization of observations that were
excluded from the transformation process within a pharmacometric model.
The plot includes both the included and excluded observations, with the
excluded ones color-coded by reason for exclusion.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">p.obs.excluded(vachette_data)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table><tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>vachette_data</code></td>
<td>
<p>An object of class <code>vachette_data</code>, which contains
the necessary data for plotting.</p>
</td>
</tr></table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The function  plots the reference and query curves along
with the observations. Observations that were excluded from the transformation
process are highlighted and labeled with the reason for exclusion, while
included observations are shown in light grey.
</p>
<p>The plot's title includes the model name, and the caption provides details
about the reference covariate(s) used. The x-axis range is dynamically set
based on the minimum and maximum x values from the original observations.
If the x-axis is logarithmic, the axis label is adjusted accordingly.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A <code>ggplot2</code> object representing the excluded observations and
their corresponding reasons for exclusion. The plot also displays the typical
reference and query curves for comparison.
