<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This data set is provided for the purposes of illustrating the use of
the software.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data(variantData)

<h3>Format</h3>

<p>variantData is a data.frame containing 30,000 participants The
data.frame contains 10 columns, 
</p>

<dl>
<dt>ID</dt>
<dd>
<p>A unique patient identifier.</p>
</dd>
<dt>X1</dt>
<dd>
<p>A dichotomous baseline covariate; generated from B(0.5).</p>
</dd>
<dt>X2</dt>
<dd>
<p>A continuous baseline covariates; generated from N(45,10^2).</p>
</dd>
<dt>E</dt>
<dd>
<p>The entry time into the study.</p>
</dd>
<dt>A</dt>
<dd>
<p>The indicator of vaccination at entry
(1 = vaccinated at entry; 0 = not vaccinated)</p>
</dd>
<dt>U</dt>
<dd>
<p>The minimum of: time to infection, 
time to refusing study vaccine after unblinding
(placebo participants only), or censoring 
(due to loss to followup or administrative censoring).</p>
</dd>
<dt>Delta</dt>
<dd>
<p>Infection-variant category indicator, where
-1 indicates a placebo participant that was unblinded and refused study 
vaccine; 0 indicates censoring; and
= ve indicates a participant infected with variant ve (ve = 1, ..., nV).</p>
</dd> 
<dt>R</dt>
<dd>
<p>The minimum of: time to unblinding, time to infection, or
time to censoring.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Gamma</dt>
<dd>
<p>Indicator of the R dynamic, where 1 indicates that R is the
time to unblinding and 0 indicates that R is either the time to infection
or the time to censoring.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Psi</dt>
<dd>
<p>Indicator of whether a placebo subject received study vaccine, 
where 1
indicates that a participant that was either assigned to vaccine or was
assigned to placebo, was 
unblinded and decided to get the study vaccine; 0 otherwise.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>All time variables are on the scale of weeks.
