<h3>Details</h3>


<p>The data frame is a subset of the entire data set which was
collected from a confidential self-administered questionnaire
administered in a large New Zealand workforce observational
study conducted during 1992–3. The data were augmented
by a second study consisting of retirees. The data can be
considered a reasonable representation of the white male New
Zealand population in the early 1990s.  There were physical,
lifestyle and psychological variables that were measured.
The psychological variables were headed
"Questions about your feelings".
</p>
<p>Although some data cleaning was performed and logic checks
conducted, anomalies remain. Some variables, of course,
are subject to a lot of measurement error and bias.  It is
conceivable that some participants had poor reading skills!
In particular, the smoking variables contain a small
percentage of conflicting values, and when <code>NA</code>s are taken
into account then there would be several different ways
the data might be cleaned.
If <code>smokeever == 0</code> then strictly speaking, only
<code>smokepassive</code> is the other variable—the other
smoking variables should either be <code>NA</code> or <code>0</code>.
</p>


<h3>Warning </h3>

<p>More variables may be added in the future and these may
be placed in any column position. Therefore references
such as <code>xs.nz[, 12]</code> are dangerous.
Also, variable names may change in the future as well as
their format or internal structure,
e.g., <code>factor</code> versus <code>numeric</code>.
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>More error checking are needed for the
pregnancy
and
smoking variables.
