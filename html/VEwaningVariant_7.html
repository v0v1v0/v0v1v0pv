<h2>Estimation of Vaccine Efficacy Over Time - Variant Aware</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Implements methods for inference on potential waning of vaccine
efficacy and for estimation of vaccine efficacy at a user-specified time
after vaccination based on data from a randomized, double-blind,
placebo-controlled vaccine trial in which participants may be unblinded
and placebo subjects may be crossed over to the study vaccine.  The
method allows for variant specification and adjustment for possible 
confounding via inverse
probability weighting through specification of models for the trial
entry process, unblinding mechanisms, censoring process, and the 
probability an unblinded placebo participant accepts study vaccine.
