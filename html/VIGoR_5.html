An example of response variables.

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A vector consisting of 500 samples.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Y mimicked phenotypic values in quantitative genetics. Y was created from X (SNP genotypes) and Z (fixed effect). 10 SNPs in X have additive effects, and 5 out of 10 SNPs have dominance effects further. Y also include environmental noises. The variances of additive, dominance, and noise are approximately 1 : 1 : 1.
