<h2>Fixing a Quantile Regression having Crossing</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Returns a similar object fitted with columns of the constraint
matrices amalgamated so it is a
partially parallel VGLM object.
The columns combined correspond to certain crossing quantiles.
This applies especially to an extlogF1() VGLM object.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">fix.crossing.vglm(object, maxit = 100, trace = FALSE, ...)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>object</code></td>
<td>

<p>an object such as
a <code>vglm</code> object with
family function <code>extlogF1</code>.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>maxit, trace</code></td>
<td>

<p>values for overwriting components in <code>vglm.control</code>.
Setting these to <code>NULL</code> will mean
the values in <code>vglm.control</code> on <code>object</code> will
be retained.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>...</code></td>
<td>

<p>additional optional arguments.
Currently unused.

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The quantile crossing problem has been described as
<em>disturbing</em> and <em>embarrassing</em>.
This function was specifically written for
a <code>vglm</code> with family function <code>extlogF1</code>.
It examines the fitted quantiles of <code>object</code> to see if any cross.
If so, then a pair of columns is combined to make those
two quantiles parallel.
After fitting the submodel it then repeats testing for
crossing quantiles and repairing them, until there is
no more quantile crossing detected.
Note that it is possible that the quantiles cross in
some subset of the covariate space not covered by the
dataâ€”see <code>is.crossing</code>.
</p>
<p>This function is fragile and likely to change in the future.
For <code>extlogF1</code> models, it is assumed
that argument <code>data</code> has been assigned a data frame,
and
that the default values of the argument <code>parallel</code>
has been used; this means that the second constraint
matrix is <code>diag(M)</code>.
The constraint matrix of the intercept term remains unchanged
as <code>diag(M)</code>.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>An object very similar to the original object, but
with possibly different constraint matrices
(partially parallel) so as to remove any quantile crossing.
