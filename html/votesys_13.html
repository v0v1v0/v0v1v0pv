<h2>Create a vote Object that can be used in counting methods</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Some counting methods in this package only accept <code>vote</code> object created by 
this function. So the first step should always be using this function. The function 
will return the modified ballots and some other helpful information. See Details 
and Values.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">create_vote(x, xtype = 2, candidate = NULL, isna = NULL)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>x</code></td>
<td>
<p>a data.frame, matrix or list of raw ballots. See Details.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>xtype</code></td>
<td>
<p>should be 1, 2 (default) or 3, designating the 
type of <code>x</code>. See Details.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>candidate</code></td>
<td>
<p>if <code>xtype</code> is 1, this argument is ignored. 
If <code>xtype</code> is 2 or 3, candidate names
must be given as a character or numeric vector. If a name is not given, 
but is still on a ballot, then the name is ignored !</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>isna</code></td>
<td>
<p>entries which should be taken as NAs. 
<code>NA</code> in <code>x</code> will always be taken as missing value, 
however, you can add more (e.g., you may use 99, 999 as missing values). 
If x contains characters, 
this argument should also be provided with a 
character vector, and if numeric, then numeric vector. Do 
not add <code>NA</code> to <code>isna</code>, because the default (NULL)  
means <code>NA</code> is already included.</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The function accepts the following input:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p> (1) when <code>xtype</code> is 1, x must be a matrix. Column names are candidate names (if
column names are NULL, they will be created: x1, x2, x3...). Candidate number is the number 
of columns of the matrix. Entry ij is the numeric score assigned by 
the ith voter to the jth candidate.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> (2) when <code>xtype</code> is 2, x can be a matrix or data.frame. 
Candidate number is the length of <code>candidate</code>. 
Entries are names (character or numeric) of candidates. 
The i1, i2, i3... entries are the 1st, 2nd, 
3rd... preferences of voter i.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> (3) when <code>xtype</code> is 3, x should be a list. 
Each element of the list is a ballot, a vector 
contains the names (character or numeric) of candidates. 
The 1st preference is in the 1st position of 
the vector, the 2nd preference is in the 2nd position... The number of candidates is the length 
of <code>candidate</code>; as a result, a ballot with number of names 
larger than candidate number is 
labelled as wrong.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The function also returns Condorcet matrix. Suppose candidates are i, j, k. 
The voter likes i best, so he assigns 1 to i. The 2nd choice is j, so 
he assigns 2 to j, leaving k as NA. Now computing the Condorcet matrix: 
since i's score is smaller than j' score, we add 1 to the ij cell of the matrix, 
and add 0 to the ji cell. Candidate k's NA is automatically set to the 
highest (that is, the worst) score: 3 (since there are 3 candidates); i &lt; k, so 
we add 1 to the ik cell and add 0 to ki cell. Besides, there is also a score 
difference matrix: we add 2 - 1 = 1 to the ij cell of score difference matrix, 
and add 3 - 1 = 2 to the ik cell. If tie appears, both sides acquire 0.
</p>
<p>Note the ways we calculate the Condorcet matrix. (1) It allow ties, that is, 
duplicated score values. (2) NA is deems as the worst, which means: if a 
voter does not mention a candidate, the candidate will be given the 
highest (worst) score. (3) Ballots mention only one name are assumed 
to express preference, since unmentioned candidates are assumed to 
be equally hated. (4) The Condorcet matrix returned 
by <code>create_vote</code> uses ballots that may have duplicated values 
and have only one valid entry. However, Condorcet family 
methods in this package provide possibility to recalculate the matrix. 
And, the simplest way to get rid of duplicated values and NAs is 
to delete some ballots.

<h3>Value</h3>

<p>an object of class <code>vote</code> is returned, which 
is essentially a list. It has the following elements.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p> (1) <code>call</code> the call.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> (2) <code>ballot</code> the returned ballot. It is always a score matrix. 
The column names are candidate names; entries are numeric scores 
assigned by voters. Missing values are all set to NA.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> (3) <code>nas</code> those which are taken as NA in data cleaning.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> (4) <code>candidate</code> candidate names.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> (5) <code>candidate_num</code> number of candidates.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> (6) <code>ballot_num</code> number of ballots.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> (7) <code>ballot_at_least_one</code> number of ballots that mention
at least one candidate.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> (8) <code>cdc</code> the Condorcet matrix calculated with ballots 
that have no NA entries.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> (9) <code>cdc_with_na</code> the Condorcet matrix calculated with 
ballots that have at least one valid entry.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> (10) <code>dif</code> the score difference matrix calculated with 
ballots that have no NA entries.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> (11) <code>dif_with_na</code> the score difference matrix calculated 
with ballots that have at least one valid entry.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> (12) <code>row_with_na</code> rows of <code>ballot</code> with NAs.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> (13) <code>row_non_na</code> for rows with NAs, the number of 
non-NA entries of them.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> (14) <code>row_with_dup</code> rows of <code>ballot</code> with 
duplicated score values.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> (15) <code>approval_able</code> if length of <code>row_non_dup</code> 
is 0, then it is TRUE, else, FALSE. It indicates whether approval 
method can be used. When <code>xtype</code> is 2 or 3, it is always TRUE.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
