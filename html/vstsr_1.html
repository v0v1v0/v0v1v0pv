<h2>vstsr: A package connecting R and Azure DevOps</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This package takes a look at the Azure DevOps API calls and wraps them around in easy to use R functions. This
includes looking at projects, repositories, work items, and eventually sections such as builds and releases.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>For more information about Azure DevOps APIs, take a look at <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/vsts">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/vsts</a>
</p>


<h3>Projects</h3>

<p>This looks at the projects available in a visual studio instance. This lets you change between any project that you might
have access to.
</p>


<h3>Repositories</h3>

<p>This looks primarily at the Git repositories available, and whether you want to create a new repository or delete an existing one.
</p>


<h3>Work Items</h3>

<p>This will track any existing work item for a project, and also the ability to create a new work item for a project. Useful if working
within a development team and automate inclusion of creating bugs upon creating any certain R error.
</p>


<h3>Releases</h3>

<p>This will look at the releases available for a project, both the definitions and the actual releases. There is the ability to
deploy the created releases to a new environment.
</p>


<h3>Custom</h3>

<p>For any non-predefined API service available in the package, it is always possible to run the <code>vsts_run_command</code> which
will use any enabled Azure DevOps API call.
