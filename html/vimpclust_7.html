<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The <code>plot</code> function allows to represent the regularization paths for a grid of values of <code>lambda</code>, as well as several quality criteria associated to the 
clustering. 
</p>
<p>For both <code>groupsparsewkm</code> and <code>sparsewkm</code> functions, the following options are available:
</p>
<p>If <code>what=weights.features</code>, the regularization paths for the weights associated to the variables are displayed. 
</p>
<p>If <code>what=sel.features</code>, the graph represents the number of selected variables for each value of the regularization parameter <code>lambda</code>. In the case of 
sparse weighted k-means for mixed data, categorical variables are represented with dotted lines so that one easily identifies them. 
</p>
<p>If <code>what=expl.var</code>, the explained variance (computed as the contribution of the between-class variance to the global variance) is displayed. This criterion is 
computed for all variables in the data set, without taking into account the weights of the group or of the variables. 
</p>
<p>If <code>what=w.expl.var</code>, the explained weighted variance is computed. The difference with the criterion above is that the weights of the variables are
taken into account in the computation. This leads to a criterion which, for large regularization parameters <code>lambda</code>, may be computed on one variable only, if 
its weight becomes equal to 1 and all the others are discarded. 
</p>
<p>If <code>what=pen.crit</code>, the graph displays the evolution of the penalized criterion, maximized by the algorithm. This criterion writes as 
the between-class weighted sum-of-squares, penalized by a group L1-norm. For more details on the mathematical expressions, one may refer to Chavel et al. (2020). 
</p>
<p>For the outcome of the <code>groupsparsewkm</code> function trained on numerical data only, two more options are available:
</p>
<p>If <code>what=weights.groups</code>, the regularization paths for the weights associated to the groups of variables are displayed.
</p>
<p>If <code>what=sel.groups</code>, the graph represents the number of selected groups for each value of the regularization parameter <code>lambda</code>.
</p>
<p>For the outcome of the <code>sparsewkm</code> function trained on mixed data, two more options are also available:
</p>
<p>If <code>what=weights.levels</code>, the regularization paths for the weights associated to the levels of the categorical variables are displayed. 
</p>
<p>If <code>what=sel.levels</code>, the graph represents the number of selected levels associated to the categorical variables plus the number of selected 
numerical variables, for each value of the regularization parameter <code>lambda</code>.
</p>
<p>If the number of groups in <code>groupsparsewkm</code> or if the number of features in <code>sparsewkm</code> are too large to have easily interpretable graphics, one may select 
some groups or some variables using the argument <code>Which</code>. Note that when training <code>sparsewkm</code> on mixed data, the initial order of the variables is changed:
after the processing step, numerical variables are displayed first, and categorical second. The indexing provided in <code>Which</code> should take this into account (see the
Examples section).
