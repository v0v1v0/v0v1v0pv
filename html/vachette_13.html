<h2>Plot Scaling Factors for Typical Curves</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function generates a ggplot2 visualization of the scaling factors applied
to the typical curves within a pharmacometric model. The plot differentiates between
reference and query curves and illustrates how scaling factors vary across
segments.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">p.scaling.factor(vachette_data)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table><tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>vachette_data</code></td>
<td>
<p>An object of class <code>vachette_data</code>, which contains
the necessary data for plotting.</p>
</td>
</tr></table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The function creates a plot that displays
the x-scaling factors for the curves, with different segments color-coded.
The plot is faceted by curve type (reference or query).
</p>
<p>The plot's title includes the model name, and the caption provides details
about the reference covariate(s) used. The x-axis range is dynamically set
based on the minimum and maximum x values, before and after scaling.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A <code>ggplot2</code> object representing the scaling factors for the curves.
The plot includes facets for each curve type (reference or query),
and it shows the scaling factors as a function of the x-axis values.
