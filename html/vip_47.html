<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Computes model-specific variable importance scores depending on the class of
<code>object</code>:
</p>

<ul>
<li> <p>C5.0 - Variable importance is measured by determining
the percentage of training set samples that fall into all the terminal nodes
after the split. For example, the predictor in the first split automatically
has an importance measurement of 100 percent since all samples are affected
by this split. Other predictors may be used frequently in splits, but if the
terminal nodes cover only a handful of training set samples, the importance
scores may be close to zero. The same strategy is applied to rule-based
models and boosted versions of the model. The underlying function can also
return the number of times each predictor was involved in a split by using
the option <code>metric = "usage"</code>. See C5imp for
details.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p>cubist - The Cubist output contains variable usage
statistics. It gives the percentage of times where each variable was used in
a condition and/or a linear model. Note that this output will probably be
inconsistent with the rules shown in the output from summary.cubist. At each
split of the tree, Cubist saves a linear model (after feature selection) that
is allowed to have terms for each variable used in the current split or any
split above it. Quinlan (1992) discusses a smoothing algorithm where each
model prediction is a linear combination of the parent and child model along
the tree. As such, the final prediction is a function of all the linear
models from the initial node to the terminal node. The percentages shown in
the Cubist output reflects all the models involved in prediction (as opposed
to the terminal models shown in the output). The variable importance used
here is a linear combination of the usage in the rule conditions and the
model. See summary.cubist and
varImp for details.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p>glmnet - Similar to (generalized) linear models,
the absolute value of the coefficients are returned for a specific model.
It is important that the features  (and hence, the estimated coefficients) be
standardized prior to fitting the model. You can specify which coefficients
to return by passing the specific value of the penalty parameter via the
<code>lambda</code> argument (this is equivalent to the <code>s</code> argument in
coef.glmnet). By default, <code>lambda = NULL</code> and the coefficients
corresponding to the final penalty value in the sequence are returned; in
other words, you should ALWAYS SPECIFY <code>lambda</code>! For cv.glmnet
objects, the largest value of lambda such that the error is within one standard
error of the minimum is used by default. For a multinomial response, the
coefficients corresponding to the first class are used; that is, the first
component of coef.glmnet.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p>cforest - Variable importance is measured in a
way similar to those computed by importance.
Besides the standard version, a conditional version is available that
adjusts for correlations between predictor variables. If
<code>conditional = TRUE</code>, the importance of each variable is computed by
permuting within a grid defined by the predictors that are associated (with
1 - <em>p</em>-value greater than threshold) to the variable of interest. The
resulting variable importance score is conditional in the sense of beta
coefficients in regression models, but represents the effect of a variable in
both main effects and interactions. See Strobl et al. (2008) for details.
Note, however, that all random forest results are subject to random
variation. Thus, before interpreting the importance ranking, check whether
the same ranking is achieved with a different random seed - or otherwise
increase the number of trees ntree in ctree_control.
Note that in the presence of missings in the predictor variables the
procedure described in Hapfelmeier et al. (2012) is performed. See
varimp for details.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p>earth - The earth package uses
three criteria for estimating the variable importance in a MARS model (see
evimp for details):
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p> The <code>nsubsets</code> criterion (<code>type = "nsubsets"</code>) counts the
number of model subsets that include each feature. Variables that are
included in more subsets are considered more important. This is the
criterion used by summary.earth to print variable
importance. By "subsets" we mean the subsets of terms generated by
<code>earth()</code>'s backward pass. There is one subset for each model size
(from one to the size of the selected model) and the subset is the best set
of terms for that model size. (These subsets are specified in the
<code style="white-space: pre;">⁠$prune.terms⁠</code> component of <code>earth()</code>'s return value.) Only
subsets that are smaller than or equal in size to the final model are used
for estimating variable importance. This is the default method used by
vi_model.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> The <code>rss</code> criterion (<code>type = "rss"</code>) first calculates the
decrease in the RSS for each subset relative to the previous subset during
<code>earth()</code>’s backward pass. (For multiple response models, RSS's are
calculated over all responses.) Then for each variable it sums these
decreases over all subsets that include the variable. Finally, for ease of
interpretation the summed decreases are scaled so the largest summed
decrease is 100. Variables which cause larger net decreases in the RSS are
considered more important.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> The <code>gcv</code> criterion (<code>type = "gcv"</code>) is similar to the
<code>rss</code> approach, but uses the GCV statistic instead of the RSS. Note
that adding a variable can sometimes increase the GCV. (Adding the variable
has a deleterious effect on the model, as measured in terms of its
estimated predictive power on unseen data.) If that happens often enough,
the variable can have a negative total importance, and thus appear less
important than unused variables.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li> <p>gbm - Variable importance is computed using one of
two approaches (See summary.gbm for details):
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p> The standard approach (<code>type = "relative.influence"</code>) described
in Friedman (2001). When <code>distribution = "gaussian"</code> this returns the
reduction of squared error attributable to each variable. For other loss
functions this returns the reduction attributable to each variable in sum
of squared error in predicting the gradient on each iteration. It describes
the <em>relative influence</em> of each variable in reducing the loss
function. This is the default method used by vi_model.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> An experimental permutation-based approach
(<code>type = "permutation"</code>). This method randomly permutes each predictor
variable at a time and computes the associated reduction in predictive
performance. This is similar to the variable importance measures Leo
Breiman uses for random forests, but gbm currently computes using
the entire training dataset (not the out-of-bag observations).
</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li> <p>H2OModel - See h2o.varimp or visit
<a href="https://docs.h2o.ai/h2o/latest-stable/h2o-docs/variable-importance.html">https://docs.h2o.ai/h2o/latest-stable/h2o-docs/variable-importance.html</a>
for details.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p>nnet - Two popular methods for constructing variable
importance scores with neural networks are the Garson algorithm
(Garson 1991), later modified by Goh (1995), and the Olden algorithm
(Olden et al. 2004). For both algorithms, the basis of these importance
scores is the network’s connection weights. The Garson algorithm determines
variable importance by identifying all weighted connections between the nodes
of interest. Olden’s algorithm, on the other hand, uses the product of the
raw connection weights between each input and output neuron and sums the
product across all hidden neurons. This has been shown to outperform the
Garson method in various simulations. For DNNs, a similar method due to
Gedeon (1997) considers the weights connecting the input features to the
first two hidden layers (for simplicity and speed); but this method can be
slow for large networks.. To implement the Olden and Garson algorithms, use
<code>type = "olden"</code> and <code>type = "garson"</code>, respectively. See
garson and olden
for details.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p>lm/glm - In (generalized) linear models,
variable importance is typically based on the absolute value of the
corresponding <em>t</em>-statistics (Bring, 1994). For such models, the sign of the
original coefficient is also returned. By default, <code>type = "stat"</code> is used;
however, if the inputs have been appropriately standardized then the raw
coefficients can be used with <code>type = "raw"</code>. Note that Bring (1994)
provides motivation for using the absolute value of the associated
<em>t</em>-statistics.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p>sparklyr - The Spark ML
library provides standard variable importance measures for tree-based methods
(e.g., random forests). See
ml_feature_importances for details.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p>randomForest Random forests typically
provide two measures of variable importance.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p> The first measure is computed from permuting out-of-bag (OOB) data: for
each tree, the prediction error on the OOB portion of the data is recorded
(error rate for classification and MSE for regression). Then the same is
done after permuting each predictor variable. The difference between the
two are then averaged over all trees in the forest, and normalized by the
standard deviation of the differences. If the standard deviation of the
differences is equal to 0 for a variable, the division is not done (but the
average is almost always equal to 0 in that case).
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> The second measure is the total decrease in node impurities from
splitting on the variable, averaged over all trees. For classification, the
node impurity is measured by the Gini index. For regression, it is measured
by residual sum of squares.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>See importance for details, including
additional arguments that can be passed via the <code>...</code> argument in
vi_model.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p>cforest - Same approach described in
cforest (from package <strong>partykit</strong>) above. See
varimp and varimpAUC (if <code>type = "auc"</code>)
for details.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p>ranger - Variable importance for
ranger objects is computed in the usual way for random
forests. The approach used depends on the <code>importance</code> argument provided
in the initial call to ranger. See
importance for details.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p>rpart - As stated in one of the rpart
vignettes. A variable may appear in the tree many times, either as a primary
or a surrogate variable. An overall measure of variable importance is the sum
of the goodness of split measures for each split for which it was the primary
variable, plus "goodness" * (adjusted agreement) for all splits in which it
was a surrogate. Imagine two variables which were essentially duplicates of
each other; if we did not count surrogates, they would split the importance
with neither showing up as strongly as it should. See
rpart for details.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p>caret - Various model-specific and model-agnostic
approaches that depend on the learning algorithm employed in the original
call to caret. See varImp for details.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p>xgboost - For linear models, the variable
importance is the absolute magnitude of the estimated coefficients. For that
reason, in order to obtain a meaningful ranking by importance for a linear
model, the features need to be on the same scale (which you also would want
to do when using either L1 or L2 regularization). Otherwise, the approach
described in Friedman (2001) for gbms is used. See
xgb.importance for details. For tree models, you
can obtain three different types of variable importance:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p> Using <code>type = "gain"</code> (the default) gives the fractional contribution of
each feature to the model based on the total gain of the corresponding
feature's splits.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Using <code>type = "cover"</code> gives the number of observations related to each
feature.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Using <code>type = "frequency"</code> gives the percentages representing
the relative number of times each feature has been used throughout each
tree in the ensemble.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li> <p>lightgbm - Same as for xgboost
models, except lgb.importance (which this method
calls internally) has an additional argument, <code>percentage</code>, that defaults to
<code>TRUE</code>, resulting in the VI scores shown as a relative percentage; pass
<code>percentage = FALSE</code> in the call to <code>vi_model()</code> to produce VI scores for
lightgbm models on the raw scale.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A tidy data frame (i.e., a tibble object) with two
columns:
</p>

<ul>
<li> <p><code>Variable</code> - the corresponding feature name;
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>Importance</code> - the associated importance, computed as the average change in
performance after a random permutation (or permutations, if <code>nsim &gt; 1</code>) of
the feature in question.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>For lm/glm-like objects, the sign (i.e., POS/NEG)
of the original coefficient is also included in a column called <code>Sign</code>.
