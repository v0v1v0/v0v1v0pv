<h2>Virtual Arrays</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The base class '<code>VirtualArray</code>' is defined, which acts as a wrapper around lists allowing users to fold arbitrary sequential data into n-dimensional, R-style virtual arrays. The derived '<code>XArray</code>' class is defined to be used for homogeneous lists that contain a single class of objects. The '<code>RasterArray</code>' and '<code>SfArray</code>' classes enable the use of stacked spatial data instead of lists.

This is still the pre-alpha version. As is R, this is free software and comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY. Nevertheless, notes about found bugs and suggestions are more than welcome.
