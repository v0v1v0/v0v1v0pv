<h2>Topic_Model_Validation Repository Overview</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The 'Topic_Model_Validation' repository is a collection of scripts and functions for performing topic modeling and evaluating topic models. This document provides an overview of the different scripts and functions in the repository and their purpose.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>## Python Scripts
### evaluate.py
The 'evaluate.py' script provides functions for evaluating the performance of topic models on different datasets and tasks. The functions within this script include:
- <code>R4WSItasktest()</code>: Evaluates the performance of a topic model on the R4WSI task, which involves predicting the top k words for a given topic.
- <code>allR4WSItasktest()</code>: Evaluates the performance of a topic model on multiple versions of the R4WSI task.
- <code>goldR4WSItest()</code>: Evaluates the performance of a topic model on a gold-standard R4WSI dataset.
- <code>heldouttest()</code>: Evaluates the performance of a topic model on held-out data.
- <code>keypostedtest()</code>: Evaluates the performance of a topic model on a key-posted dataset.
- <code>masstest()</code>: Evaluates the performance of a topic model on a massive dataset.
- <code>modtest()</code>: Evaluates the performance of a topic model on a given dataset.
- <code>resultstest()</code>: Evaluates the performance of a topic model on a given dataset and stores the results.
### record.py
The 'record.py' script provides a function for storing the results of topic model evaluations. The function within this script is:
- <code>record()</code>: Stores the results of topic model evaluations.
## R Scripts
### lda.R
The 'lda.R' script provides functions for performing Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic modeling on text data. The functions within this script include:
- <code>lda_model()</code>: Fits an LDA model to text data.
### lsa.R
The 'lsa.R' script provides functions for performing Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) topic modeling on text data. The functions within this script include:
- <code>lsa_model()</code>: Fits an LSA model to text data.
### evaluate.R
The 'evaluate.R' script provides functions for evaluating the performance of topic models using various metrics, such as perplexity and coherence. The functions within this script include:
- <code>evaluate_model()</code>: Evaluates the performance of a topic model using various metrics.
### helpers.R
The 'helpers.R' script provides various helper functions that are used by the other scripts in the repository. The functions within this script include:
- <code>clean_text()</code>: Cleans and preprocesses text data for use in topic modeling.
- <code>read_data()</code>: Reads in text data from a file.
- <code>write_data()</code>: Writes text data to a file.
