<h2>Plot Observations and Typical Curves for Query and Reference Data</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function generates a ggplot2 visualization of the observations and typical curves
for both query and reference data within a pharmacometric model. It is designed to
compare the observed data against the typical reference and query curves.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">p.obs.ref.query(vachette_data)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table><tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>vachette_data</code></td>
<td>
<p>An object of class <code>vachette_data</code>, which contains
the necessary data for plotting.</p>
</td>
</tr></table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The function plots the query and reference data,
differentiating them using distinct colors. Observations are represented
by points, while the typical curves are depicted as lines.
</p>
<p>The plot's title includes the model name, and the caption provides details
about the reference covariate(s) used. The x-axis range is dynamically set
based on the minimum and maximum x values, before and after scaling.
If the x-axis is logarithmic, the axis label is adjusted accordingly.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A <code>ggplot2</code> object representing the observations and typical curves.
The plot displays the query and reference curves and their corresponding observations,
color-coded for easy comparison.
