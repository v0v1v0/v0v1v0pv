<h2>Main Vachette Plot</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function generates the main Vachette plot, which visualizes all transformed
data points within a pharmacometric model. The plot makes a clear distinction
between reference data points (those that were not moved, shown in red) and
transformed query data points (those that were moved, shown in purple).
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">p.vachette(vachette_data)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table><tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>vachette_data</code></td>
<td>
<p>An object of class <code>vachette_data</code>, which contains
the necessary data for plotting.</p>
</td>
</tr></table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The function plots all the data points, highlighting
reference points in red and transformed query points in purple. The plot
also overlays reference curves, with extrapolated segments displayed as
dashed lines if available. The subtitle provides information about the
error model used (additive or proportional) and the number of excluded
observations.
</p>
<p>The plot's title includes the model name, and the caption provides details
about the reference covariate(s) used. The x-axis range is dynamically set
based on the scaled x values. If the x-axis is logarithmic, the axis label
is adjusted accordingly.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A <code>ggplot2</code> object representing, which
includes all observations, with reference data points shown in red, and
transformed query data points shown in purple. The plot also includes
reference curves and, if applicable, extrapolated reference curves as dashed lines.
