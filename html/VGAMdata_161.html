<h2> Smoking Data in the NHANES 2017–2020 Cycle </h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Selected variables mainly focussed on the smoking
questionnaire of the 
National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
collected during 1.5 cycles just prior to Covid-19.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data(smqP)
</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame with the following variables.
</p>

<dl>
<dt>SEQN</dt>
<dd>
<p>Identifier for individuals that can be used
to merge in other data sets from the same cycle.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>TC30</dt>
<dd>    
<p>Numeric.
Tobacco consumption:
average number of cigarettes/day during past 30 days.
Aka <code>SMD650</code> with some preprocessing.
</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>SCA</dt>
<dd>
<p>Smoking cessation age (SCA).
Is missing for those who have not quit.
Computing this involved variables
<code>SMQ050Q</code>, <code>SMQ050U</code> and <code>age</code>.
The variable <code>SMQ050Q</code> is for
<code>How long since (you) quit smoking cigarettes?</code>
and
<code>SMQ050U</code> are the units
(e.g., years, months, days).
The variable <code>SMQ050Q</code> is right-censored
at 50 years (66666 means 50 or more years)
and for such people SCA was set to <code>NA</code>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>TCquit</dt>
<dd>

<p>Tobacco consumption:
number of cigarettes smoked per day when quit.
Aka <code>SMD057</code> with some preprocessing.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>SIA</dt>
<dd>   
<p>Smoking initiation age (SIA):
age when individuals started smoking cigarettes regularly.
Aka <code>SMD030</code> with some preprocessing.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>age, gender</dt>
<dd>
<p>Age (<code>RIDAGEYR</code>) when surveyed;
the value 80 is right-censored,
i.e., subjects 80 years or older were recorded as 80.
Gender is <code>RIAGENDR</code> .
</p>
</dd>
<dt>race, race2</dt>
<dd>
<p>Race (<code>RIDRETH1</code>) and a
binary simplification of race
(<code>"Non-Hispanic White"</code> versus
<code>"Others"</code>).
</p>
</dd>
<dt>educ, marital</dt>
<dd>
<p>Education (<code>DMDEDUC2</code>) and
marital status (<code>DMDMARTZ</code>).
Both variables were not collected for those
aged 12–19, hence those are <code>NA</code>s.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>poverty_ratio</dt>
<dd>
<p>Ratio of family income to poverty (<code>INDFMPIR</code>).
</p>
</dd>
<dt>meals_fastfood_pizza, diet, readytoeat_foods</dt>
<dd>
<p>For example,
for the first one, this is
the number of meals from a fast food or pizza place
(<code>DBD900</code>) during the last 7 days, where
the value 5555 means more than 21 meals per week,
the value 7777 means the person refused to answer, and
the value 9999 means the person didn't know.
The other variables may be described later in more detail.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>frozen_meals</dt>
<dd>
<p>To be described later.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>people_fam_smoking, people_home_smoking</dt>
<dd>
<p>Numeric.
For <code>people_fam_smoking</code>, this is
Number of people who live here smoke tobacco?
(<code>SMD460</code>). For this,
0 is: No one in household is a smoker;
1 is: 1 household member is a smoker;
2 is: 2 or more household members are smokers.
</p>
<p>For <code>people_home_smoking</code>, this is
the number of people who smoke inside this home?
(<code>SMD470</code>). For this,
0 is: No one smokes inside the house;
1 is: 1 household member smokes inside the house;
2 is: 2 or more household members smoke inside the house.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>use_cigarettes, use_pipes, use_cigars</dt>
<dd>
<p>Use during the last 5 days of smoking variants.
The codes are <code>SMQ690A</code>, <code>SMQ690B</code>, <code>SMQ690C</code>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>use_hookah, use_ecigarettes</dt>
<dd>
<p>The codes are <code>SMQ690G</code>, <code>SMQ690H</code>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>use_snuff, use_otherSmokeless</dt>
<dd>
<p>The codes are <code>SMQ690E</code>, <code>SMQ690K</code>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>passiveSmoke_job, passiveSmoke_rest</dt>
<dd>
<p>Binary 0 (no) or 1 (yes)
measuring exposure to passive smoke at
certain places in the past 7 days,
e.g.,
While you were working at a job or business outside
of the home,
did someone else smoke cigarettes or other tobacco
products indoors?
The codes are <code>SMQ858</code>, <code>SMQ862</code>.
</p>

</dd>
<dt>passiveSmoke_bar, passiveSmoke_car</dt>
<dd>
<p>See above.
The codes are <code>SMQ868</code>, <code>SMQ872</code>.
</p>

</dd>
<dt>passiveSmoke_home, passiveSmoke_other</dt>
<dd>
<p>See above.
The codes are <code>SMQ876</code>, <code>SMQ880</code>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>passiveSmoke_ecigarettes</dt>
<dd>
<p>See above.
The code is <code>SMQ940</code>.

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
(NHANES)
is a well-known longitudinal study located in USA
(a country just north of Mexico).
This data frame shares a selection of variables mainly
to do with the smoking questionnaire
(codeword: <code>SMQ</code>);
some demographic and anthropometric variables
might also be included and/or added later.
The significance of <code>P</code> is that the
2019–2020 cycle was not completed due to Covid-19,
hence this data concerns 2017–2020 and is a merging of
the 2017–2018 cycle (data codenamed <code>J</code>) with
further data collected just prior to the pandemic.
</p>
<p>The original data has been preprocessed and/or simplified.
For example, <code>"Don't know"</code> and <code>"Refused"</code>
usually have been converted to a <code>NA</code>.
</p>
<p>This data frame is subject to change,
especially with the addition of new variables.
