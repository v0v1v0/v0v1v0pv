<h2>Functional Diversity and Community Distances from Species Trees</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p> Functional diversity is defined as the total branch
length in a trait dendrogram connecting all species, but excluding
the unnecessary root segments of the tree (Petchey and Gaston
2006). Tree distance is the increase in total branch length when
combining two sites.  </p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">treedive(comm, tree, match.force = TRUE, verbose = TRUE)
treeheight(tree)
treedist(x, tree, relative = TRUE, match.force = TRUE, ...)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>comm, x</code></td>
<td>
<p>Community data frame or matrix.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>tree</code></td>
<td>
<p>A dendrogram which for <code>treedive</code> must be for species
(columns).</p>
</td>

<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>match.force</code></td>
<td>
<p>Force matching of column names in data
(<code>comm</code>, <code>x</code>) and labels in <code>tree</code>. If <code>FALSE</code>,
matching only happens when dimensions differ (with a warning or
message). The order of data must match to the order in <code>tree</code>
if matching by names is not done.</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Function <code>treeheight</code> finds the sum of lengths of connecting
segments in a dendrogram produced by <code>hclust</code>, or other
dendrogram that can be coerced to a correct type using
<code>as.hclust</code>. When applied to a clustering of species
traits, this is a measure of functional diversity (Petchey and Gaston
2002, 2006), and when applied to phylogenetic trees this is
phylogenetic diversity.
</p>
<p>Function <code>treedive</code> finds the <code>treeheight</code> for each site
(row) of a community matrix. The function uses a subset of
dendrogram for those species that occur in each site, and excludes
the tree root if that is not needed to connect the species (Petchey
and Gaston 2006). The subset of the dendrogram is found by first
calculating <code>cophenetic</code> distances from the input
dendrogram, then reconstructing the dendrogram for the subset of the
cophenetic distance matrix for species occurring in each
site. Diversity is 0 for one species, and <code>NA</code> for empty
communities.
</p>
<p>Function <code>treedist</code> finds the dissimilarities among
trees. Pairwise dissimilarity of two trees is found by combining
species in a common tree and seeing how much of the tree height is
shared and how much is unique. With <code>relative = FALSE</code> the
dissimilarity is defined as <code class="reqn">2 (A \cup B) - A - B</code>, where
<code class="reqn">A</code> and <code class="reqn">B</code> are heights of component trees and
<code class="reqn">A \cup B</code> is the height of the combined tree. With <code>relative = TRUE</code>
the dissimilarity is <code class="reqn">(2(A \cup B)-A-B)/(A \cup B)</code>. 
Although the latter formula is similar to
Jaccard dissimilarity (see <code>vegdist</code>,
<code>designdist</code>), it is not in the range <code class="reqn">0 \ldots 1</code>, since combined tree can add a new root. When two zero-height
trees are combined into a tree of above zero height, the relative
index attains its maximum value <code class="reqn">2</code>. The dissimilarity is zero
from a combined zero-height tree.
</p>
<p>The functions need a dendrogram of species traits or phylogenies as an
input. If species traits contain <code>factor</code> or
<code>ordered</code> factor variables, it is recommended to use Gower
distances for mixed data (function <code>daisy</code> in
package <span class="pkg">cluster</span>), and usually the recommended clustering method
is UPGMA (<code>method = "average"</code> in function <code>hclust</code>)
(Podani and Schmera 2006). Phylogenetic trees can be changed into
dendrograms using function <code>as.hclust.phylo</code> in the
<span class="pkg">ape</span> package.
</p>
<p>It is possible to analyse the non-randomness of tree diversity
using <code>oecosimu</code>. This needs specifying an adequate Null
model, and the results will change with this choice.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

 
<p>A vector of diversity values or a single tree height, or a
dissimilarity structure that inherits from <code>dist</code> and
can be used similarly.

<p>Function <code>treedive</code> is similar to the phylogenetic
diversity function <code>pd</code> in the package <span class="pkg">picante</span>, but
excludes tree root if that is not needed to connect species. Function
<code>treedist</code> is similar to the phylogenetic similarity
<code>phylosor</code> in the package <span class="pkg">picante</span>, but excludes
unneeded tree root and returns distances instead of similarities.
</p>
<p><code>taxondive</code> is something very similar from another bubble.
