<h2> Trimmed Constraint Matrices </h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Deletes statistically nonsignficant regression coefficients via
their constraint matrices, for future refitting.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">trim.constraints(object, sig.level = 0.05, max.num = Inf,
                 intercepts = TRUE, ...)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>object</code></td>
<td>

<p>Some <span class="pkg">VGAM</span> object, especially having
class <code>vglmff-class</code>.
It has not yet been tested on non-<code>"vglm"</code> objects.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>sig.level</code></td>
<td>

<p>Significance levels, with values in <code class="reqn">[0, 1]</code>.
Columns of constraint matices whose p-values are larger than
this argument are deleted.
With terms that generate more than one column of the
<code>"lm"</code> model matrix, all p-values must be greater
than this argument for deletion.
This argument is recycled to the total number of
regression coefficients of <code>object</code>.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>max.num</code></td>
<td>

<p>Numeric, positive and integer-valued.
Maximum number of regression coefficients allowable for deletion.
This allows one to limit the number of deleted coefficients.
For example,
if <code>max.num = 1</code> then only the largest p-value is used
for the deletion,
provided it is larger than <code>sig.level</code>.
The default is to delete all those coefficients whose
p-values are greater than <code>sig.level</code>.
With a finite value,
this argument will probably not work properly
when there are terms that
generate more than one column of the LM model matrix.
Having a value greater than unity might be unsuitable
in the presence of multicollinearity because all
correlated variables might be eliminated at once.
</p>


</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>intercepts</code></td>
<td>

<p>Logical. Trim the intercept term?
If <code>FALSE</code> then the constraint matrix for the
<code>"(Intercept)"</code> term is left unchanged.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>...</code></td>
<td>

<p>Unused but for provision in the future.

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This utility function is intended to simplify an existing
<code>vglm</code> object having
variables (terms) that affect unnecessary parameters.
Suppose the explanatory variables in the formula
includes a simple numeric covariate called <code>x2</code>.
This variable will affect every linear predictor if
<code>zero = NULL</code> in the <span class="pkg">VGAM</span> family function.
This situation may correspond to the constraint matrices having
unnecessary columns because their regression coefficients are
statistically nonsignificant.
This function attempts to delete those columns and
return a possibly simplified list of constraint matrices
that can make refitting a simpler model easy to do.
P-values obtained from <code>summaryvglm</code>
(with <code>HDEtest = FALSE</code> for increased speed)
are compared to <code>sig.level</code> to test for
statistical significance.
</p>
<p>For terms that generate more than one column of the
<code>"lm"</code> model matrix,
such as <code>bs</code> and <code>poly</code>,
the column is deleted if all regression coefficients
are statistically nonsignificant.
Incidentally, users should instead use
<code>sm.bs</code>,
<code>sm.ns</code>,
<code>sm.poly</code>,
etc.,
for smart and safe prediction.
</p>
<p>One can think of this function as facilitating
<em>backward elimination</em> for variable selection,
especially if <code>max.num = 1</code> and <code class="reqn">M=1</code>,
however usually more than one regression coefficient is deleted
here by default.
</p>





<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A list of possibly simpler constraint matrices
that can be fed back into the model using the
<code>constraints</code> argument
(usually <code>zero = NULL</code> is needed to avoid a warning).
Consequently, they are required to be of the <code>"term"</code>-type.
After the model is refitted, applying
<code>summaryvglm</code> should result in
regression coefficients that are ‘all’ statistically
significant.
</p>


<h3>Warning </h3>

<p>This function has not been tested thoroughly.
One extreme is that a term is totally deleted because
none of its regression coefficients are needed,
and that situation has not yet been finalized.
Ideally, <code>object</code> only contains terms where at least
one regression coefficient has a p-value less than
<code>sig.level</code>.
For ordered factors and other situations, deleting
certain columns may not make sense and destroy interpretability.
</p>
<p>As stated above, <code>max.num</code> may not work properly
when there are terms that
generate more than one column of the LM model matrix.
However, this limitation may change in the future.
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>This function is experimental and may be replaced by
some other function in the future.
This function does not use S4 object oriented programming
but may be converted to such in the future.
