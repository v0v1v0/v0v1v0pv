<h2>ANOVA-Type Estimation of Mixed Models</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Estimate/Predict random effects employing ANOVA-type estimation and obtain generalized least squares estimates
of fixed effects for any linear mixed model including random models and linear models.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">anovaMM(
  form,
  Data,
  by = NULL,
  VarVC.method = c("scm", "gb"),
  NegVC = FALSE,
  quiet = FALSE,
  order.data = TRUE
)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>form</code></td>
<td>
<p>(formula) specifying the linear mixed model (fixed and random part of the model),
all random terms need to be enclosed by round brackets. Any variable not being bracketed
will be considered as fixed. Interaction terms containing at least one random factor
will automatically be random (Piepho et al. 2003). All terms appearing in the model 
(fixed or random) need to be compliant with the regular expression "^[^[\.]]?[[:alnum:]_\.]*$",
i.e. they may not start with a dot and may then only consist of alpha-numeric characters, 
dot and underscore. Otherwise, an error will be issued.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>Data</code></td>
<td>
<p>(data.frame) containing all variables referenced in 'form', note that variables can only be
of type "numeric", "factor" or "character". The latter will be automatically converted to "factor".</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>by</code></td>
<td>
<p>(factor, character) variable specifying groups for which the analysis should be performed individually,
i.e. by-processing</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>VarVC.method</code></td>
<td>
<p>(character) string specifying whether to use the algorithm given in Searle et al. (1992) which corresponds to <code>VarVC.method="scm"</code> or in
Giesbrecht and Burns (1985) which can be specified via "gb". Method "scm" (Searle, Casella, McCulloch)
is the exact algorithm, "gb" (Giesbrecht, Burns) is termed "rough approximation"
by the authors, but sufficiently exact compared to e.g. SAS PROC MIXED (method=type1) which
uses the inverse of the Fisher-Information matrix as approximation. For balanced designs all
methods give identical results, only in unbalanced designs differences occur.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>NegVC</code></td>
<td>
<p>(logical) FALSE = negative variance component estimates (VC) will be set to 0 and they will not 
contribute to the total variance (as done e.g. in SAS PROC NESTED, conservative estimate of total variance). 
The original ANOVA estimates can be found in element 'VCoriginal'. 
The degrees of freedom of the total variance are based on adapted mean squares (MS) (see details).
TRUE = negative variance component estimates will not be set to 0 and they will contribute to the total 
variance (original definition of the total variance).</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>quiet</code></td>
<td>
<p>(logical) TRUE = will suppress any warning, which will be issued otherwise</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>order.data</code></td>
<td>
<p>(logical) TRUE = class-variables will be ordered increasingly, FALSE = ordering of class-variables
will remain as is</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>A Linear Mixed Model, noted in standard matrix notation, can be written as <code class="reqn">y = Xb + Zg + e</code>, where
<code class="reqn">y</code> is the column vector of observations, <code class="reqn">X</code> and <code class="reqn">Z</code> are design matrices assigning fixed (<code class="reqn">b</code>),
respectively, random (<code class="reqn">g</code>) effects to observations, and <code class="reqn">e</code> is the column vector of residual errors.
Whenever there is an intercept in the model, i.e. the substring "-1" is not part of the model formula, the same
restriction as in SAS PROC MIXED is introduced setting the last fixed effect equal to zero. Note, that the results
of an linear contrasts are not affected by using an intercept or not, except that constrained fixed effects cannot
be part of such contrasts (one could use the intercept estimated instead).
</p>
<p>Here, no further restrictions on the type of model are made. One can fit mixed models as well as random models, which
constitute a sub-set of mixed models (intercept being the only fixed effect). Variables must be either of type "numeric"
or "factor". "character" variables are automatically converted to factors and the response variable has to be numeric, of course.
In case that 'class(Data[,i])' is neither one of these three options, an error is issued.
Even simple linear models can be fitted, i.e. models without a random part (without <code class="reqn">Zg</code>) besides the
residual errors. In this case, an Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) table is computed in the same way as done by function 'anova.lm'.
</p>
<p>One drawback of using ANOVA-type estimation of random effects is, that random effects are independent, i.e they have
zero covariance by definition <code class="reqn">cov(g_i,g_j) = 0</code>. Another one is that estimated variance components may become negative
under certain conditions. The latter situation is addressed by setting negative variance estimates equal to zero and adapting
ANOVA mean squares (MS) as <code class="reqn">MS = C * VC</code>, where <code class="reqn">C</code> is a coefficient matrix and a function of the design matrix <code class="reqn">[X Z]</code>
and <code class="reqn">VC</code> is the column-vector of adapted variance components. The Satterthwaite approximation of total degrees of freedom 
(DF for total variance) will use adapted <code class="reqn">MS</code>-values.
</p>
<p>Note, that setting negative VCs equal to zero results in a conservative estimate of the total variance, i.e. it will be larger than
the estimate including the negative VC(s). Use parameter 'NegVC=TRUE' to explicitly allow negative variance estimates.
