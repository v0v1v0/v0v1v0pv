<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The data were collected in late 2023 and is
described in detail in Garcia et al. (2023).
Almost all the information here comes from
that document.
The original data comprised each year from
2001 to 2022 inclusive, however only the years
2001, 2010, 2019 and 2022 are included here
for brevity.
</p>
<p>Variables with values
<code>"Unknown/Organisation"</code>
were treated as missing and deleted.
The <code>rownames</code> were
stripped off to make the data frame
much smaller.
</p>
<p>A matching
New Zealand Police data set on proceedings
against offenders was also collected but
not included in <span class="pkg">VGAMdata</span> because of
its size.
</p>
<p>Offences are categorised using the Australian
and New Zealand Standard Offence Classification
(ANZSOC).  There are sixteen top level
‘divisions’ which are further subdivided into
‘subdivisions’ and ‘groups’.  One of the sixteen
main divisions (Traffic Offences) are excluded.
Only the most serious offence by the offender
is recorded here.
</p>
<p>Each row contains the count of sentences
received by offenders with particular
demographic information in the given period,
along with the ANZSOC offence code. However,
since ANZSOC is a hierarchical classification, a
unique offender is represented in three separate
rows: one for the ANZSOC Group of the offence,
one for the Subdivision of the offence, and
one for the Division of the offence.
