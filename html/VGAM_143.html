<h2> Fitting Constrained Additive Ordination (CAO) </h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A constrained additive ordination (CAO) model is fitted using
the <em>reduced-rank vector generalized additive model</em>
(RR-VGAM) framework.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">cao(formula, family = stop("argument 'family' needs to be assigned"),
    data = list(),
    weights = NULL, subset = NULL, na.action = na.fail,
    etastart = NULL, mustart = NULL, coefstart = NULL,
    control = cao.control(...), offset = NULL,
    method = "cao.fit", model = FALSE, x.arg = TRUE, y.arg = TRUE,
    contrasts = NULL, constraints = NULL,
    extra = NULL, qr.arg = FALSE, smart = TRUE, ...)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>formula</code></td>
<td>

<p>a symbolic description of the model to be fit.  The RHS of
the formula is used to construct the latent variables, upon
which the smooths are applied.  All the variables in the
formula are used for the construction of latent variables
except for those specified by the argument <code>noRRR</code>,
which is itself a formula.  The LHS of the formula contains
the response variables, which should be a matrix with each
column being a response (species).
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>family</code></td>
<td>

<p>a function of class <code>"vglmff"</code> (see <code>vglmff-class</code>)
describing what statistical model is to be fitted. This is called a
“<span class="pkg">VGAM</span> family function”.  See <code>CommonVGAMffArguments</code>
for general information about many types of arguments found in this
type of function.
See <code>cqo</code> for a list of those presently implemented.
</p>
</td>

<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>data</code></td>
<td>

<p>an optional data frame containing the variables in
the model.  By default the variables are taken from
<code>environment(formula)</code>, typically the environment
from which <code>cao</code> is called.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>weights</code></td>
<td>

<p>an optional vector or matrix of (prior) weights to be used
in the fitting process.  For <code>cao</code>, this argument
currently should not be used.
</p>
</td>

<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>subset</code></td>
<td>

<p>an optional logical vector specifying a subset of
observations to be used in the fitting process.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>na.action</code></td>
<td>

<p>a function which indicates what should happen when
the data contain <code>NA</code>s.  The default is set by the
<code>na.action</code> setting of <code>options</code>, and
is <code>na.fail</code> if that is unset.  The “factory-fresh”
default is <code>na.omit</code>.
</p>
</td>

For <code>cao</code>, this argument currently should not be used.
</p>
</td>

<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>mustart</code></td>
<td>

<p>starting values for the fitted values. It can be a vector
or a matrix.  Some family functions do not make use of
this argument.  For <code>cao</code>, this argument currently
should not be used.

<p>logical values indicating whether the model matrix and
response vector/matrix used in the fitting process should

<td>

<p>an optional list  of constraint matrices.  For

The components of the list must be named with the term it

the <code class="reqn">M</code> by <code class="reqn">M</code> identity matrix unless arguments
in the family function itself override these values.

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The arguments of <code>cao</code> are a mixture of those from
<code>vgam</code> and <code>cqo</code>, but with some extras
in <code>cao.control</code>. Currently, not all of the
arguments work properly.
</p>
<p>CAO can be loosely be thought of as the result of fitting
generalized additive models (GAMs) to several responses
(e.g., species) against a very small number of latent
variables.  Each latent variable is a linear combination of
the explanatory variables; the coefficients <b>C</b> (called
<code class="reqn">C</code> below) are called <em>constrained coefficients</em>
or <em>canonical coefficients</em>, and are interpreted as
weights or loadings. The <b>C</b> are estimated by maximum
likelihood estimation.  It is often a good idea to apply
<code>scale</code> to each explanatory variable first.
</p>
<p>For each response (e.g., species), each latent variable
is smoothed by a cubic smoothing spline, thus CAO is
data-driven. If each smooth were a quadratic then CAO
would simplify to <em>constrained quadratic ordination</em>
(CQO; formerly called <em>canonical Gaussian ordination</em>
or CGO).  If each smooth were linear then CAO would simplify
to <em>constrained linear ordination</em> (CLO). CLO can
theoretically be fitted with <code>cao</code> by specifying
<code>df1.nl=0</code>, however it is more efficient to use
<code>rrvglm</code>.
</p>
<p>Currently, only <code>Rank=1</code> is implemented, and only
<code>noRRR = ~1</code> models are handled.
</p>






<p>With binomial data, the default formula is
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><code class="reqn">logit(P[Y_s=1]) = \eta_s = f_s(\nu), \ \ \ s=1,2,\ldots,S</code>
</p>

<p>where <code class="reqn">x_2</code> is a vector of environmental variables, and
<code class="reqn">\nu=C^T x_2</code> is a <code class="reqn">R</code>-vector of latent
variables.  The <code class="reqn">\eta_s</code> is an additive predictor
for species <code class="reqn">s</code>, and it models the probabilities
of presence as an additive model on the logit scale.
The matrix <code class="reqn">C</code> is estimated from the data, as well as
the smooth functions <code class="reqn">f_s</code>.  The argument <code>noRRR =
  ~ 1</code> specifies that the vector <code class="reqn">x_1</code>, defined for
RR-VGLMs and QRR-VGLMs, is simply a 1 for an intercept.  Here,
the intercept in the model is absorbed into the functions.
A <code>clogloglink</code> link may be preferable over a
<code>logitlink</code> link.
</p>
<p>With Poisson count data, the formula is
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><code class="reqn">\log(E[Y_s]) = \eta_s = f_s(\nu)</code>
</p>

<p>which models the mean response as an additive models on the
log scale.
</p>
<p>The fitted latent variables (site scores) are scaled to have
unit variance.  The concept of a tolerance is undefined for
CAO models, but the optimums and maximums are defined. The
generic functions <code>Max</code> and <code>Opt</code>
should work for CAO objects, but note that if the maximum
occurs at the boundary then <code>Max</code> will return a
<code>NA</code>.  Inference for CAO models is currently undeveloped.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>An object of class <code>"cao"</code>
(this may change to <code>"rrvgam"</code> in the future).
Several generic functions can be applied to the object, e.g.,
<code>Coef</code>, <code>concoef</code>, <code>lvplot</code>,
<code>summary</code>.
</p>


<h3>Warning </h3>

<p>CAO is very costly to compute. With version 0.7-8 it took
28 minutes on a fast machine. I hope to look at ways of
speeding things up in the future.
</p>
<p>Use <code>set.seed</code> just prior to calling
<code>cao()</code> to make your results reproducible.  The reason
for this is finding the optimal CAO model presents a difficult
optimization problem, partly because the log-likelihood
function contains many local solutions. To obtain the
(global) solution the user is advised to try <em>many</em>
initial values.  This can be done by setting <code>Bestof</code>
some appropriate value (see <code>cao.control</code>). Trying
many initial values becomes progressively more important as
the nonlinear degrees of freedom of the smooths increase.
</p>







<h3>Note</h3>

<p>CAO models are computationally expensive, therefore setting
<code>trace = TRUE</code> is a good idea, as well as running it
on a simple random sample of the data set instead.
</p>
<p>Sometimes the IRLS algorithm does not converge within
the FORTRAN code. This results in warnings being issued.
In particular, if an error code of 3 is issued, then this
indicates the IRLS algorithm has not converged. One possible
remedy is to increase or decrease the nonlinear degrees of
freedom so that the curves become more or less flexible,
respectively.
