<h3>Details</h3>

<p>In Vega, for now, there are only two time-zones available: the local
time-zone of the browser where the spec is rendered, and UTC. This differs
from R, where a time-zone attribute is available to <code>POSIXct</code> vectors.
Accordingly, when designing a vegaspec that uses time, you have to make some
some compromises. This function helps you to implement your compromise in
a principled way, as explained in the opinions below.
</p>
<p>Let's assume that your <code>POSIXct</code> data has a time-zone attached.
There are three different scenarios for rendering this data:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p> using the time-zone of the browser
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> using UTC
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> using the time-zone of the data
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If you intend to display the data using the <strong>time-zone of the browser</strong>,
or using <strong>UTC</strong>, you should serialize datetimes using ISO-8601, i.e.
<code>iso_dttm = TRUE</code>. In the rest of your vegaspec, you should choose
local or UTC time-scales accordingly. However, in either case, you should
use local time-units. No compromise is necessary.
</p>
<p>If you intend to display the data using the <strong>time-zone of the browser</strong>,
this is where you will have to compromise. In this case, you should
serialize using <code>iso_dttm = FALSE</code>. By doing this, your datetimes will be
serialized using a non-ISO-8601 format, and notably, <strong>using the time-zone</strong>
of the datetime. When you design your vegaspec, you should treat this as
if it were a UTC time. You should direct Vega to parse this data as UTC,
i.e. <code>{"foo": "utc:'%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S'"}</code>. In other words, Vega should
interpret your local timestamp as if it were a UTC timestamp.
As in the first UTC case, you should use UTC time-scales and local
time-units.
</p>
<p>The compromise you are making is this: the internal representation of
the instants in time will be different in Vega than it will be in R.
You are losing information because you are converting from a <code>POSIXct</code>
object with a time-zone to a timestamp without a time-zone. It is also
worth noting that the time information in your Vega plot should not
be used anywhere else - this should be the last place this serialized
data should be used because it is no longer trustworthy. For this,
you will gain the ability to show the data in the context of its
time-zone.
</p>
<p>Dates can be different creatures than datetimes. I think that can be
"common currency" for dates. I think this is because it is more common to
compare across different locations using dates as a common index. For
example, you might compare daily stock-market data from NYSE, CAC-40, and
Hang Seng. To maintain a common time-index, you might choose UTC to
represent the dates in all three locations, despite the time-zone
differences.
</p>
<p>This is why the default for <code>iso_date</code> is <code>TRUE</code>. In this scenario,
you need not specify to Vega how to parse the date; because of its
ISO-8601 format, it will parse to UTC. As with the other UTC cases,
you should use UTC time-scales and local time-units.
