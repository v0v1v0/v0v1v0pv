<h3>Details</h3>

<p>From Shen (2001),
the basin is located in the province of Quebec, Canada, and
it covers an area of 2690 square km.  The data comprises 77
years daily streamflow data from 1919 to 1995 from the HYDAT CD
(Environment Canada, 1998). In the basin, winter lasts for about
4 months and precipitation is mainly in the form of snowfall
during this period. Spring represents the high flow season due
to the contribution of spring snowmelt to river runoff and the
spring flood is the annual maximum flood both in flood peak
and volume. A typical flood hydrograph with its characteristic
values are:
flood peak <code class="reqn">Q</code>,
flood volume <code class="reqn">V</code>,
and flood duration <code class="reqn">D</code>.
These flood characteristics are determined by first identifying
the flood duration: the dates of start and end of flood runoff
using the approach proposed by Yue (2000).
Generally, time boundaries of a flood are marked by a rise
in stage and discharge from base flow (start of flood runoff)
and a return to base flow (end of flood runoff).
