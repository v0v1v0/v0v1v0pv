<h2>vacuum: Tukey's Vacuum Cleaner</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>An implementation of three procedures developed by 
John Tukey: FUNOP (FUll NOrmal Plot), FUNOR-FUNOM 
(FUll NOrmal Rejection-FUll NOrmal Modification), and vacuum cleaner. 
Combined, they provide a way to identify, treat, and analyze outliers 
in two-way (i.e., contingency) tables, as described in his 
landmark paper "The Future of Data Analysis", Tukey, John W. (1962) 
&lt;https://www.jstor.org/stable/2237638&gt;.
