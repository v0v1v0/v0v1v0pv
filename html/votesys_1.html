<h2>Voting Systems, Instant-Runoff Voting, Borda Method, Various Condorcet Methods</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This package provides different methods for counting ballots, which 
can be used in election, decision making and evaluation. The basic 
idea is: different forms of ballots can all be transformed into a 
score matrix; then the score matrix can be put into different 
counting methods. The functions 
in this package provide more flexibility to deal with duplicated 
values (ties) and missing values. And the comparison of results 
of different methods is also made easy.

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R"># Suppose we have the following ballot data
raw &lt;- list2ballot(
    x = list(
        c('m', 'n', 'c', 'k'), c('n', 'c', 'k', 'm'), 
        c('c', 'k', 'n', 'm'), c('k', 'c', 'n', 'm'), c(NA, NA, NA, NA)
    ) , 
    n = c(42, 26, 15, 17, 3)
)

# Step 1: check validity of ballots. Delete  
# some of them, if needed.
check_validity &lt;- check_dup_wrong(raw, 
    xtype = 3, 
    candidate = c("m", "n", "k", "c")
)
raw &lt;- raw[- check_validity$row_all_na]

# Step 2: create a vote object
vote &lt;- create_vote(raw, xtype = 3, candidate = c("m", "n", "k", "c"))

# Step 3: use one or more methods
y &lt;- plurality_method(vote) # winner is m
y &lt;- irv_method(vote) # winner is k
y &lt;- cdc_simple(vote) # winner is n
y &lt;- cdc_rankedpairs(vote) # winner is n
