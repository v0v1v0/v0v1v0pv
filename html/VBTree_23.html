<h2>
Vector Binary Tree to Make Your Data Management More Efficient
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Vector binary tree provides a new data structure, to
 make your data visiting and management more efficient. If the
 data has structured column names, it can read these names and
 factorize them through specific split pattern, then build the mappings
 within double list, vector binary tree, array and tensor mutually, through
 which the batched data processing is achievable easily. The methods of
 array and tensor are also applicable. Detailed methods are described in
 Chen Zhang et al. (2020) &lt;doi:10.35566/isdsa2019c8&gt;.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This package provide an efficient approach to manage data by structurizing the column names. A column name is generally seen as a character object, while if
it has a very organized pattern, such as "*-*-*-*" for example (each * mark presents a different condition), it must has a certain mapping relationship to a
specific tensor. This package uses two data structure: double list and vector binary tree, to implement the conversion between the character vector and tensor.
It affords various inquiry methods, which was mainly drived by vector binary tree, to extract the highly customizable subset from original data.

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">
#View the data to be visited:
summary(datatest)
colnames(datatest)

#Structurize colnames of data into vector binary tree:
dl &lt;- chrvec2dl(colnames(datatest))
vbt &lt;- dl2vbt(dl)
vbt

#Setting subset in different forms, for example the pattern
#"Strain-(900~1100)-(0.01, 1)-0.6" is desired:
subunregdl &lt;- list(c(1), c(1:5), c(2,4), c(1)) # undifined double list
subregdl &lt;- advbtinq(vbt, subunregdl) # regularized double list
subvbt &lt;- dl2vbt(subregdl) # sub vector binary tree
subts &lt;- vbt2ts(subvbt) # tensor
subarr &lt;- vbt2arr(subvbt) # array
subchrvec &lt;- as.vector(subarr) # character vector

#Visit the data through different methods:
datavisit(datatest, subunregdl) # by handmade double list
datavisit(datatest, subregdl) # by defined double list
datavisit(datatest, subvbt) # by vector binary tree
datavisit(datatest, subts) # by tensor
datavisit(datatest, subarr) # by array
datavisit(datatest, subchrvec) # by character vector
