<h2> Bitterness in Wine Data

</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This oenological data frame concerns the amount of bitterness
in 78 bottles of white wine.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data(wine)
</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame with 4 rows on the following 7 variables.
</p>

<dl>
<dt>temp</dt>
<dd>
<p>temperature, with levels cold and warm.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>contact</dt>
<dd>
<p>whether contact of the juice with the
skin was allowed or avoided, for a specified period.
Two levels: no or yes.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>bitter1, bitter2, bitter3, bitter4, bitter5</dt>
<dd>
<p>numeric vectors, the counts.
The order is none to most intense.
</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The data set comes from Randall (1989) and concerns a factorial
experiment for investigating factors that affect the
bitterness of white
wines. There are two factors in the experiment:
temperature at the time
of crushing the grapes and contact of the juice
with the skin.  Two
bottles of wine were fermented for each of the
treatment combinations.
A panel of 9 judges were selected and trained
for the ability to detect
bitterness.  Thus there were 72 bottles in total.
Originally, the
bitterness of the wine were taken on a
continuous scale in the interval
from 0 (none) to 100 (intense) but later they
were grouped using equal
lengths into five ordered categories 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5.
