<h3>Details</h3>

<p>According to Wiki,
in February 1722 Captain Ogle was sent by
the British Government to find and capture
the notorious pirate
Bartholomew Roberts
(real name: John Roberts, but also known
later as Black Bart).
When his warship
caught up with the <em>Royal Fortune</em> he attacked and
Bartholomew Roberts was the first to fall, followed by
2 others.
The remaining pirates surrendered soon afterwards.
A total of 272 men were captured, and
of these, 65 were
black, and they were sold into slavery. The remainder were taken to Cape
Coast Castle, apart from those who died on the voyage back.
The trial was held in April, 1722, and
54 were condemned to death, of whom 52 were hanged and two were reprieved.
Of those executed, their personal data (name, age, habitation)
were recorded.
