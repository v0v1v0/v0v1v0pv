<h2>Plot Observations and <code>vachette</code> Transformed Observations with Connecting Arrows</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function generates a ggplot2 visualization of observations and their transformations
within a pharmacometric model. The plot superimposes the observed query and reference data
from original to <code>vachette</code> transformed values, showing direction of transformation.
Reference and query curves are additionally overlaid for comparison.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">p.vachette.arrow(vachette_data)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table><tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>vachette_data</code></td>
<td>
<p>An object of class <code>vachette_data</code>, which contains
the necessary data for plotting.</p>
</td>
</tr></table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The function plots the original and <code>vachette</code> transformed observations,
with arrows showing the transformation path. Reference and query curves are
also plotted, with extrapolated reference curves displayed as dashed lines
if available. The subtitle provides information about the error model used
(additive or proportional) and the number of excluded observations.
</p>
<p>The plot's title includes the model name, and the caption provides details
about the reference covariate(s) used. The x-axis range is dynamically set
based on the scaled x values. If the x-axis is logarithmic, the axis label
is adjusted accordingly.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A <code>ggplot2</code> object representing the observations, their transformations,
and the corresponding reference and query curves. The plot also indicates if any
extrapolated reference curves are present and how many observations were excluded
from the transformation.
