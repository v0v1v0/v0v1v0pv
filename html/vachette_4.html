<h2>Plot Observations and Typical Curves Faceted by Covariate</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function generates a ggplot2 visualization of observations and typical
curves within a pharmacometric model, faceted by unique covariate values (ucov).
The plot compares the observed data against the typical reference and query curves,
with each facet representing a different covariate value.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">p.obs.cov(vachette_data)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table><tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>vachette_data</code></td>
<td>
<p>An object of class <code>vachette_data</code>, which contains
the necessary data for plotting.</p>
</td>
</tr></table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The function begins by ensuring that the input <code>vachette_data</code>
is of the correct class. It then constructs a plot that displays the reference
and query data, differentiating them using distinct colors, and faceting the
plot by unique covariate values. Observations are represented by points,
while the typical curves are depicted as lines.
</p>
<p>The plot's title includes the model name, and the caption provides details
about the reference covariate(s) used. The x-axis range is dynamically set
based on the minimum and maximum x values, before and after scaling.
If the x-axis is logarithmic, the axis label is adjusted accordingly.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A <code>ggplot2</code> object representing the observations and typical curves,
faceted by covariate. The plot displays both the reference and query curves
and their corresponding observations, color-coded for easy comparison.
