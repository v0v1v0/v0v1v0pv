Trout Data at the Te Whaiau Trap on Lake Otamangakau

</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Rainbow and brown trout trapped at the
Te Whaiau Trap at
Lake Otamangakau in the central North Island of New Zealand.
The data were collected by the Department of Conservation.
</p>



<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data(trapO)</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame with 1226 observations on the following 15 variables.
</p>

<dl>
<dt>Date</dt>
<dd>
<p>Date as a class <code>"Date"</code> variable.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>BFTW, BMTW, RFTW, RMTW</dt>
<dd>
<p>numeric vectors,
the number of fish trapped daily.
<code>B</code>/<code>R</code> is for brown/rainbow trout.
<code>F</code>/<code>M</code> is for female/male.
<code>TW</code> is for the Te Whaiau trap location
(there was another trap just off the Tongariro River).
</p>
</dd>
<dt>MinAT, MaxAT</dt>
<dd>
<p>numeric vectors,
daily minimum and maximum ambient temperatures
in Celsius.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Rain</dt>
<dd>
<p>numeric vector,
daily rainfall that has been scaled between 0 (none)
and 100 (flooding situation).
</p>
</dd>
<dt>LevelTW</dt>
<dd>
<p>numeric vector,
water level of the stream  that has been scaled between 0 (none)
and 100 (flooding situation).
In a flooding situation it is possible that some fish going
upstream were not caught.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Year, Month, Day</dt>
<dd>
<p>numeric vectors,
extracted from <code>Date</code>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>doy</dt>
<dd>
<p>a numeric vector,
Julian day of year. The value 1 means 1st of January,
and so on up to 365.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>f.Year</dt>
<dd>
<p>a factor vector,
the year as a factor.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>fict.Year</dt>
<dd>
<p>similar to <code>Date</code> but a fictitional year
is used for all the data. This allows all the
data to be plotted along one calendar year.
</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h3>Details</h3>


<p>These are the daily numbers of fish trapped at the Te Whaiau trap
near Lake Otamangakau, during the winter months when spawning is at
its peak.
These fish were all going upstream.
There are two species of trout, split up by males and
females, in the data set. The first is brown trout (<em>Salmo
trutta</em>) and the second is rainbow trout (<em>Oncorhynchus
mykiss</em>). Information on the movement patterns of brown and
rainbow trout in Lake Otamangakau and Lake Te Whaiau can be found
in Dedual et al. (2000).
</p>
<p>Brown trout are more sedentary compared with rainbow trout,
and spawning activities of brown trout occur between May and
June whilst peak spawning of rainbow trout occurs between July
and August.  Furthermore, brown trout have been observed avoiding
water above 19 degrees Celsius and optimum temperatures for growth
are between 10–15 degrees for brown trout and  16.5–17.2 degrees
for rainbow trout.
