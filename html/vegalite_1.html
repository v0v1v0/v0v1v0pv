<h2>Create Vega-Lite specs using htmlwidget idioms</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Creation of Vega-Lite spec charts is virtually 100% feature complete.
Some of the parameters to functions are only documented in TypeScript
source code which will take a bit of time to
wade through. All the visualizations you find in the
<a href="http://vega.github.io/vega-lite/gallery.html">Vega-Lite Gallery</a> work.
<br>
Functions also exist which enable creation of widgets from a JSON spec and
turning a <code>vegalite</code> package created object into a JSON spec.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>You start by calling <code>vegalite()</code> which allows you to setup core
configuration options, including whether you want to display links to
show the source and export the visualization. You can also set the background
here and the <code>viewport_width</code> and <code>viewport_height</code>. Those are
very important as they control the height and width of the widget and also
the overall area for the chart. This does <em>not</em> set the height/width
of the actual chart. That is done with <code>cell_size()</code>.
</p>
<p>Once you instantiate the widget, you need to <code>add_data()</code> which can
be <code>data.frame</code>, local CSV, TSV or JSON file (that convert to
<code>data.frame</code>s) or a non-realive URL (wich will not be read and
converted but will remain a URL in the Vega-Lite spec.
</p>
<p>You then need to <code>encode_x()</code> &amp; <code>encode_y()</code> variables that
map to columns in the data spec and choose one <code>mark_...()</code> to
represent the encoding.
</p>
<p>Here's a sample, basic Vega-Lite widget:
</p>
<pre>
  dat &lt;- jsonlite::fromJSON('[
      {"a": "A","b": 28}, {"a": "B","b": 55}, {"a": "C","b": 43},
      {"a": "D","b": 91}, {"a": "E","b": 81}, {"a": "F","b": 53},
      {"a": "G","b": 19}, {"a": "H","b": 87}, {"a": "I","b": 52}
    ]')

vegalite() 
    add_data(dat) 
    encode_x("a", "ordinal") 
    encode_y("b", "quantitative") 
    mark_bar() -&gt; vl

vl
  </pre>
<p>That is the minimum set of requirements for a basic Vega-Lite spec and
will create a basic widget.
</p>
<p>You can also convert that R widget object <code>to_spec()</code> which will return
the JSON for the Vega-Lite spec (allowing you to use it outside of R).
</p>
<pre>

to_spec(vl)

{
  "description": "",
  "data": {
    "values": [
      { "a": "A", "b": 28 }, { "a": "B", "b": 55 }, { "a": "C", "b": 43 },
      { "a": "D", "b": 91 }, { "a": "E", "b": 81 }, { "a": "F", "b": 53 },
      { "a": "G", "b": 19 }, { "a": "H", "b": 87 }, { "a": "I", "b": 52 }
    ]
  },
  "mark": "bar",
  "encoding": {
    "x": {
      "field": "a",
      "type": "nominal"
    },
    "y": {
      "field": "b",
      "type": "quantitative"
    }
  },
  "config": [],
  "embed": {
    "renderer": "svg",
    "actions": {
      "export": false,
      "source": false,
      "editor": false
    }
  }
}

</pre>
<p>If you already have a Vega-Lite JSON spec that has embedded data or a
non-realtive URL, you can create a widget from it via <code>from_spec()</code>
by passing in the full JSON spec or a URL to a full JSON spec.
</p>
<p>If you're good with HTML (etc) and want a more lightweight embedding options, you
can also use <code>embed_spec</code> which will scaffold a minimum <code>div</code> +
<code>script</code> source and embed a spec from a <code>vegalite</code> object.
</p>
<p>If you like the way Vega-Lite renders charts, you can also use them as static
images in PDF knitted documents with the new <code>capture_widget</code> function.
(NOTE that as of this writing, you can just use the development version of
<code>knitr</code> instead of this function.)
