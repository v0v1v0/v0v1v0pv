<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Functions that make population genetics summaries

gt.to.popsum(x)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>x</code></td>
<td>
<p>object of class chromR or vcfR</p>
</td>

<p>logical specifying whether to run the function (FALSE) or present deprecation message (TRUE).</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The function 'gt2popsum' was deprecated in vcfR 1.8.0.
This was because it was written entirely in R and did not perform well.
Users should use 'gt.to.popsum()' instead because it has similar
functionality but includes calls to C++ to increase its performance.
</p>
<p>This function creates common population genetic summaries from either a chromR or vcfR object.
The default is to return a matrix containing allele counts, He, and Ne.
<strong>Allele_counts</strong> is the a comma delimited string of counts.
The first position is the count of reference alleles, the second positions is the count of the first alternate alleles, the third is the count of second alternate alleles, and so on.
<strong>He</strong> is the gene diversity, or heterozygosity, of the population.
This is <code class="reqn">1 - \sum x^{2}_{i}</code>, or the probability that two alleles sampled from the population are different, following Nei (1973).
<strong>Ne</strong> is the effective number of alleles in the population.
This is <code class="reqn">1/\sum x^{2}_{i}</code> or one minus the homozygosity, from Nei (1987) equation 8.17.
