<h2>Large-scale Bayesian variable selection using variational methods</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Fast algorithms for fitting Bayesian variable selection
models and computing Bayes factors, in which the outcome (or response
variable) is modeled using a linear regression or a logistic
regression. The algorithms are based on the variational approximations
described in "Scalable variational inference for Bayesian variable
selection in regression, and its accuracy in genetic association
studies" (P. Carbonetto and M. Stephens, Bayesian Analysis 7, 2012,
pages 73-108). This software has been applied to large data sets with
over a million variables and thousands of samples.</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The main functionality of this package is implemented in function
<code>varbvs</code>. This function selects the most appropriate
algorithm for the data set and selected model (linear or logistic
regression). See <code>help(varbvs)</code> for details. The varbvs interface
is intended to resemble interface for <span class="pkg">glmnet</span>, the popular package
for fitting genealized linear models.

list of available functions, see <code>help(package=varbvs)</code>.
