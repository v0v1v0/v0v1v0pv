<h2> Variance-Covariance Matrices and Standard Errors </h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This package is designed to produce variance-covariance matrices and standard errors as directly/efficiently as possible from fit models. Default methods (e.g., in <code>stats</code>) tend to first compute the <code>summary</code> object for a model, from which the matrix is extracted. The catch is that the <code>summary</code> itself often involves several other extraneous computations. The <code>summary</code> methods are typically fast for most purposes, but falter in this regard when a user wishes to compute standard errors of perhaps thousands of models (as may happen, for example, when bootstrapping).
