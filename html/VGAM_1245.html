<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A data frame with yellow-bellied Prinia.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data(prinia)
</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame with 151 observations on the following 23 variables.
</p>

<dl>
<dt>length</dt>
<dd>
<p>a numeric vector,
the scaled wing length (zero mean and unit variance).
</p>
</dd>
<dt>fat</dt>
<dd>
<p>a numeric vector, fat index;
originally 1 (no fat) to 4 (very fat) but
converted to 0 (no fat) versus 1 otherwise.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>cap</dt>
<dd>
<p>a numeric vector,
number of times the bird was captured or recaptured.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>noncap</dt>
<dd>
<p>a numeric vector,
number of times the bird was not captured.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>y01, y02, y03, y04, y05, y06</dt>
<dd>
<p>a numeric vector of 0s and 1s; for noncapture and capture resp.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>y07, y08, y09, y10, y11, y12</dt>
<dd>
<p>same as above.

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The yellow-bellied Prinia <em>Prinia flaviventris</em>
is a common bird species located in Southeast Asia. A
capture–recapture experiment was conducted at the Mai Po
Nature Reserve in Hong Kong during 1991, where captured
individuals had their wing lengths measured and fat index
recorded. A total of 19 weekly capture occasions were
considered, where 151 distinct birds were captured.
</p>
<p>More generally, the prinias are a genus of small
insectivorous birds, and are sometimes referred to as
<em>wren-warblers</em>.  They are a little-known group of the
tropical and subtropical Old World, the roughly 30 species
being divided fairly equally between Africa and Asia.

<pre><code class="language-R">head(prinia)
summary(prinia)
rowSums(prinia[, c("cap", "noncap")])  # 19s

#  Fit a positive-binomial distribution (M.h) to the data:

#  Fit another positive-binomial distribution (M.h) to the data:
#  The response input is suitable for posbernoulli.*-type functions.
