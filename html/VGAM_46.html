<h2>Analysis of Deviance for Vector Generalized Linear Model Fits</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Compute an analysis of deviance table for one or more
vector generalized linear model fits.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">## S3 method for class 'vglm'
anova(object, ..., type = c("II", "I", "III", 2, 1, 3),
     test = c("LRT", "none"), trydev = TRUE, silent = TRUE)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table><tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>object, ...</code></td>
<td>
<p>objects of class <code>vglm</code>, typically
the result of a call to <code>vglm</code>, or a list of
<code>objects</code> for the <code>"vglmlist"</code> method.
Each model must have an intercept term.
If <code>"vglmlist"</code> is used then <code>type = 1</code> or
<code>type = "I"</code> must be specified.
</p>

</td>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>type</code></td>
<td>

<p>character or numeric;
any one of the
(effectively three) choices given.
Note that <code>anova.glm</code>
has <code>1</code> or <code>"I"</code>
as its default;
and that <code>Anova.glm()</code> in <b>car</b>
(that is, the <b>car</b> package)
has <code>2</code> or <code>"II"</code> as its default
(and allows for <code>type = "III"</code>), so
one can think of this function as
a combination of <code>anova.glm</code>
and <code>Anova.glm()</code> in <b>car</b>,
but with the default of the latter.
See Details below for more information.
</p>

<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>test</code></td>
<td>
<p>a character string,
(partially) matching one of
<code>"LRT"</code> and
<code>"none"</code>.
In the future it is hoped that <code>"Rao"</code> be also supported,
to conduct score tests.
The first value is the default.

<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>trydev</code></td>
<td>

<p>logical; if <code>TRUE</code> then the deviance is used if possible.
Note that only a few <span class="pkg">VGAM</span> family functions have a
deviance that is defined and implemented.
Setting it <code>FALSE</code> means the log-likelihood will be used.
</p>

<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>silent</code></td>

<p>logical; if <code>TRUE</code> then any warnings will be suppressed.
These may arise by IRLS iterations not converging during
the fitting of submodels.
Setting it <code>FALSE</code> means that any warnings are given.

<h3>Details</h3>

<p><code>anova.vglm</code> is intended to be similar to
<code>anova.glm</code>
so specifying a single object and <code>type = 1</code> gives a
<em>sequential</em> analysis of deviance table for that fit.
By <em>analysis of deviance</em>, it is meant loosely
that if the deviance of the model is not defined or implemented,
then twice the difference between the log-likelihoods of two
nested models remains asymptotically chi-squared distributed
with degrees of freedom equal to the difference in the number
of parameters of the two models.
Of course, the usual regularity conditions are assumed to hold.
For Type I,
the analysis of deviance table has
the reductions in the residual deviance
as each term of the formula is added in turn are given in as
the rows of a table, plus the residual deviances themselves.
<em>Type I</em> or sequential tests
(as in <code>anova.glm</code>).
are computationally the easiest of the three methods.
For this, the order of the terms is important, and the
each term is added sequentially from first to last.
</p>
<p>The <code>Anova()</code> function in <b>car</b> allows for testing
<em>Type II</em> and <em>Type III</em> (SAS jargon) hypothesis
tests, although the definitions used are <em>not</em> precisely
that of SAS.
As <b>car</b> notes,
<em>Type I</em> rarely test interesting hypotheses in unbalanced
designs.  Type III enter each term <em>last</em>, keeping all
the other terms in the model.
</p>
<p>Type II tests,
according to SAS,
add the term after all other terms have been added to the model
except terms that contain the effect being tested; an effect
is contained in another effect if it can be derived by deleting
variables from the latter effect.
Type II tests are currently the default.
</p>
<p>As in <code>anova.glm</code>, but not as
<code>Anova.glm()</code> in <b>car</b>,
if more than one object is specified, then
the table has a row for the
residual degrees of freedom and deviance for each model.
For all but the first model, the change in degrees of freedom
and deviance is also given. (This only makes statistical sense
if the models are nested.)  It is conventional to list the
models from smallest to largest, but this is up to the user.
It is necessary to have <code>type = 1</code> with more than one
objects are specified.
</p>

<p>See <code>anova.glm</code> for more details
and warnings.
The <span class="pkg">VGAM</span> package now implements full likelihood models
only, therefore no dispersion parameters are estimated.
</p>



<h3>Value</h3>

<p>An object of class <code>"anova"</code> inheriting from
class <code>"data.frame"</code>.
</p>


<h3>Warning </h3>

<p>See <code>anova.glm</code>.
Several <span class="pkg">VGAM</span> family functions implement distributions
which do not satisfying the usual regularity conditions needed for
the LRT to work. No checking or warning is given for these.
</p>
<p>As <b>car</b> says, be careful of Type III tests
because they violate marginality.
Type II tests (the default) do not have this problem.
</p>









<h3>Note</h3>

<p>It is possible for this function to <code>stop</code>
when <code>type = 2</code> or <code>3</code>, e.g.,
<code>anova(vglm(cans ~ myfactor, poissonff, data = boxcar))</code>
where <code>myfactor</code> is a factor.
</p>
<p>The code was adapted
directly from <code>anova.glm</code>
and <code>Anova.glm()</code> in <b>car</b>
by T. W. Yee.
Hence the Type II and Type III tests do <em>not</em>
correspond precisely with the SAS definition.
