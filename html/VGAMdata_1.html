Mainly Data for the VGAM package
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><span class="pkg">VGAMdata</span> is mainly an assortment of larger data sets which
are a useful resource for the <span class="pkg">VGAM</span> package.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This package mainly contains some larger data sets originally
distributed with the <span class="pkg">VGAM</span> package.
Ideally both packages can be installed and loaded to be fully functional.
The main intent was to limit the size of <span class="pkg">VGAM</span> to a bare essential.
Many data sets in my monograph will refer to data sets in either
package.
Recently, some older or less-used <span class="pkg">VGAM</span> family functions have
been shifted into <span class="pkg">VGAMdata</span>, and this is likely to
continue in the future.
