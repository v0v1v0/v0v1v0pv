<h2>Common VGAM Family Function Arguments </h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Here is a description of some common and
typical arguments found in many <span class="pkg">VGAM</span>
family functions, e.g.,
<code>zero</code>,
<code>lsigma</code>,
<code>isigma</code>,
<code>gsigma</code>,
<code>eq.mean</code>,
<code>nsimEI</code> and
<code>parallel</code>.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<h3>Arguments</h3>


<table><tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>lsigma</code></td>
<td>

<p>Character.
Link function applied to a parameter and not
necessarily a mean.  See <code>Links</code>
for a selection of choices.  If there is only
one parameter then this argument is often
called <code>link</code>.
</p>
</td>
</tr></table>
<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>isigma</code></td>
<td>

<p>Optional initial values can often be
inputted using an argument beginning with
<code>"i"</code>.  For example, <code>"isigma"</code> and
<code>"ilocation"</code>, or just <code>"init"</code>
if there is one parameter.  A value of
<code>NULL</code> means a value is computed
internally, i.e., a <em>self-starting</em>
<span class="pkg">VGAM</span> family function.  If a failure
to converge occurs make use of these types
of arguments.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>zero</code></td>
<td>

<p>An important argument,
either an integer vector, or a vector of
character strings.
</p>
<p>If an integer, then it specifies which
linear/additive predictor is modelled
as <em>intercept-only</em>.  That is,
the regression coefficients are set to
zero for all covariates except for the
intercept.  If <code>zero</code> is specified
then it may be a vector with values from
the set <code class="reqn">\{1,2,\ldots,M\}</code>.  The value
<code>zero = NULL</code> means model <em>all</em>
linear/additive predictors as functions of
the explanatory variables.  Here, <code class="reqn">M</code>
is the number of linear/additive predictors.
Technically, if <code>zero</code> contains the
value <code class="reqn">j</code> then the <code class="reqn">j</code>th row of every
constraint matrix (except for the intercept)
consists of all 0 values.
</p>
<p>Some <span class="pkg">VGAM</span> family functions allow the
<code>zero</code> argument to accept negative
values; if so then its absolute value is
recycled over each (usual) response. For
example, <code>zero = -2</code> for the
two-parameter negative binomial distribution
would mean, for each response, the second
linear/additive predictor is modelled as
intercepts-only. That is, for all the <code class="reqn">k</code>
parameters in <code>negbinomial</code>
(this <span class="pkg">VGAM</span> family function can handle
a matrix of responses).
</p>
<p>Suppose <code>zero = zerovec</code> where
<code>zerovec</code> is a vector of negative
values. If <code class="reqn">G</code> is the usual <code class="reqn">M</code>
value for a univariate response then the
actual values for argument <code>zero</code>
are all values in <code>c(abs(zerovec), G +
  abs(zerovec), 2*G + abs(zerovec), ... )</code> lying
in the integer range <code class="reqn">1</code> to <code class="reqn">M</code>.
For example, setting <code>zero = -c(2,
  3)</code> for a matrix response of 4 columns with
<code>zinegbinomial</code> (which usually
has <code class="reqn">G = M = 3</code> for a univariate response)
would be equivalent to
<code>zero = c(2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9, 11, 12)</code>.
This example has <code class="reqn">M = 12</code>.
Note that if <code>zerovec</code> contains
negative values then their absolute values
should be elements from the set <code>1:G</code>.
</p>
<p>Note: <code>zero</code> may have positive and
negative values, for example, setting
<code>zero = c(-2, 3)</code> in the above example
would be equivalent to
<code>zero = c(2, 3, 5, 8, 11)</code>.
</p>
<p>The argument <code>zero</code> also accepts
a character vector (for <span class="pkg">VGAM</span>
1.0-1 onwards).  Each value is fed into
<code>grep</code> with <code>fixed =
  TRUE</code>, meaning that wildcards <code>"*"</code>
are not useful.  See the example below—all
the variants work; those with <code>LOCAT</code>
issue a warning that that value is unmatched.
Importantly, the parameter names are
<code>c("location1", "scale1", "location2",
"scale2")</code> because there are 2 responses.  Yee
(2015) described <code>zero</code> for only numerical
input.  Allowing character input is particularly
important when the number of parameters cannot
be determined without having the actual data
first. For example, with time series data,
an ARMA(<code class="reqn">p</code>,<code class="reqn">q</code>) process might have
parameters <code class="reqn">\theta_1,\ldots,\theta_p</code> which
should be intercept-only by default. Then
specifying a numerical default value for
<code>zero</code> would be too difficult (there
are the drift and scale parameters too).
However, it is possible with the character
representation: <code>zero = "theta"</code> would
achieve this.  In the future, most <span class="pkg">VGAM</span>
family functions might be converted
to the character representation—the
advantage being that it is more readable.
When programming a <span class="pkg">VGAM</span> family function
that allows character input, the variable
<code>predictors.names</code> must be assigned
correctly.
</p>







<p>If the <code>constraints</code> argument is used
then the family function's <code>zero</code>
argument (if it exists) needs to be set to
<code>NULL</code>. This avoids what could be a
probable contradiction.  Sometimes setting
other arguments related to constraint matrices
to <code>FALSE</code> is also a good idea, e.g.,
<code>parallel = FALSE</code>,
<code>exchangeable = FALSE</code>.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>gsigma</code></td>
<td>

<p>Grid-search initial values can be inputted
using an argument beginning with <code>"g"</code>,
e.g., <code>"gsigma"</code>, <code>"gshape"</code> and
<code>"gscale"</code>.  If argument <code>isigma</code>
is inputted then that has precedence over
<code>gsigma</code>, etc.
If the grid search is 2-dimensional then it
is advisable not to make the vectors too long
as a nested <code>for</code> loop may be used.
Ditto for 3-dimensions etc.  Sometimes a
<code>".mux"</code> is added as a suffix, e.g.,
<code>gshape.mux</code>; this means that the grid
is created relatively and not absolutely,
e.g., its values are multipled by some single
initial estimate of the parameter in order
to create the grid on an absolute scale.
</p>


<p>Some family functions have an argument
called <code>gprobs.y</code>.  This is fed
into the <code>probs</code> argument of
<code>quantile</code>
in order to obtain some values of central
tendency of the response, i.e., some spread
of values in the middle.  when <code>imethod = 1</code>
to obtain an initial value for the mean
Some family functions have an argument called
<code>iprobs.y</code>, and if so, then these values
can overwrite <code>gprobs.y</code>.
</p>


</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>eq.mean</code></td>
<td>

<p>Logical.
Constrain all the means to be equal?
This type of argument is simpler than
<code>parallel</code> because only a single
<code>TRUE</code> or <code>FALSE</code> can be assigned
and 
not a formula.  Thus if <code>TRUE</code> then it
will be enforced over all variables.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>parallel</code></td>
<td>

<p>A logical, or a simple formula specifying
which terms have equal/unequal coefficients.
The formula must be simple, i.e., additive
with simple main effects terms.  Interactions
and nesting etc. are not handled.  To handle
complex formulas use the <code>constraints</code>
argument (of <code>vglm</code> etc.);
however, there is a lot more setting up
involved and things will not be as convenient.
</p>
<p>Here are some examples.
1. <code>parallel = TRUE ~ x2 + x5</code> means
the parallelism assumption
is only applied to <code class="reqn">X_2</code>, <code class="reqn">X_5</code> and
the intercept.
2.  <code>parallel = TRUE ~ -1</code>
and <code>parallel = TRUE ~ 0</code>
mean the parallelism assumption
is applied to <em>no</em> variables at all.
Similarly,
<code>parallel = FALSE ~ -1</code> and
<code>parallel = FALSE ~ 0</code>
mean the parallelism assumption
is applied to <em>all</em> the variables
including the intercept.
3.  <code>parallel = FALSE ~ x2 - 1</code>
and <code>parallel = FALSE ~ x2 + 0</code>
applies the parallelism constraint to all terms
(including the intercept) except for <code class="reqn">X_2</code>.
4.  <code>parallel = FALSE ~ x2 * x3</code>
probably will not work. Instead, expand it
out manually to get 
<code>parallel = FALSE ~ x2 + x3 + x2:x3</code>,
and that should work.
That's because the main formula processes or
expands the <code>"*"</code>
operator but <code>parallel</code> does not.
5. To check whether <code>parallel</code> has done
what was expected, type
<code>coef(fit, matrix = TRUE)</code> or
<code>constraints(fit)</code> for confirmation.
</p>
<p>This argument is common in <span class="pkg">VGAM</span> family
functions for categorical responses, e.g.,
<code>cumulative</code>,  <code>acat</code>,
<code>cratio</code>, <code>sratio</code>.
For the proportional odds model
(<code>cumulative</code>) having parallel
constraints applied to each explanatory
variable (except for the intercepts) means the
fitted probabilities do not become negative
or greater than 1. However this parallelism
or proportional-odds assumption ought to
be checked.

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>nsimEIM</code></td>
<td>

<p>Some <span class="pkg">VGAM</span> family functions use
simulation to obtain an approximate expected
information matrix (EIM).  For those that
do, the <code>nsimEIM</code> argument specifies
the number of random variates used per
observation; the mean of <code>nsimEIM</code> random
variates is taken.  Thus <code>nsimEIM</code>
controls the accuracy and a larger value
may be necessary if the EIMs are not
positive-definite.  For intercept-only models
(<code>y ~ 1)</code> the value of <code>nsimEIM</code>
can be smaller (since the common value used
is also then taken as the mean over the
observations), especially if the number of
observations is large.
</p>
<p>Some <span class="pkg">VGAM</span> family functions provide
two algorithms for estimating the EIM.
If applicable, set <code>nsimEIM = NULL</code>
to choose the other algorithm.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>imethod</code></td>
<td>

<p>An integer with value <code>1</code> or <code>2</code>
or <code>3</code> or ... which specifies the
initialization method for some parameters or
a specific parameter.  If failure to converge
occurs try the next higher value, and continue
until success.
For example, <code>imethod = 1</code> might
be the method of moments, and
<code>imethod = 2</code> might be another method.
If no value of <code>imethod</code> works then
it will be necessary to use arguments such
as <code>isigma</code>.  For many <span class="pkg">VGAM</span>
family functions it is advisable to try this
argument with all possible values to safeguard
against problems such as converging to a local
solution.  <span class="pkg">VGAM</span> family functions with
this argument usually correspond to a model
or distribution that is relatively hard to
fit successfully, therefore care is needed
to ensure the global solution is obtained.
So using all possible values that this
argument supplies is a good idea.
</p>
<p><span class="pkg">VGAM</span> family functions such
<code>genpoisson2</code> recycle
<code>imethod</code> to be of length 2 corresponding
to the 2 parameters. In the future, this
feature will be extended to other family
functions to confer more flexibility.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>Form2</code></td>
<td>

<p>Formula.
Using applied to models with <code class="reqn">M=2</code>.
Specifies the terms for <code class="reqn">\eta_2</code>
and the other terms belong to <code class="reqn">\eta_1</code>.
It is a way to partition the <b>X</b>
matrix into two sets of covariates,
where they are assigned to each <code class="reqn">\eta_j</code>
separately.
This argument sets up constraint matrices
<code>rbind(0, 1)</code>
for terms in <code>Form2</code>
and <code>rbind(1, 0)</code> for
<code>setdiff(formula, Form2)</code>
so to speak.
Note that 
sometimes this argument is only accessed
if <code>vfl = TRUE</code>.
Arguments such as <code>Form1</code> and
<code>Form3</code> are also possible in
<span class="pkg">VGAM</span> family functions because
the <code class="reqn">\eta_j</code> which is likely to be
modelled more simply is
chosen for convenience.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>vfl</code></td>
<td>

<p>A single logical.
This stands for
<em>variance–variance factored loglinear</em>
(VFL)
model.
If <code>TRUE</code> then usually
some other argument such
as <code>Form2</code> or <code>parallel</code>
is used to partition the main
<code>vglm</code> <code>formula</code>
into two sets of covariates.
For some families
such as <code>negbinomial</code>
this enables overdispersion to be modelled
conveniently via a loglinear model,
given the mean.
It is necessary to read the online help
regarding each <span class="pkg">VGAM</span> family function
because each one may different from others.
To fit some VFL models it is necessary to
make a copy of existing covariates by
creating new variable names and then
adding it to the main formula.
</p>
<p>A good question is:
why is <code>vfl</code> necessary?
Wouldn't <code>Form2</code> be sufficient?
Setting <code>vfl = TRUE</code> enables
some internal checking such
as avoiding conflicts.
For example, it is often necessary to set
<code>zero = NULL</code> and
<code>parallel = FALSE</code>, otherwise
there would be contradictions.

<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>type.fitted</code></td>
<td>

<p>Character.
Type of fitted value returned by
the <code>fitted()</code> methods function.
The first choice is always the default.
The available choices depends on what kind
of family function it is.  Using the first
few letters of the chosen choice is okay.
See <code>fittedvlm</code> for more details.
</p>
<p>The choice <code>"Qlink"</code> refers to
quantile-links, which was introduced in
December 2018 in <span class="pkg">VGAMextra</span> 0.0-2
for several 1-parameter distributions.
Here, either the <code>loglink</code>
or <code>logitlink</code> or
<code>identitylink</code> of the quantile
is the link function (and the choice is
dependent on the support of the distribution),
and link functions end in <code>"Qlink"</code>.
A limited amount of support is provided
for such links, e.g., <code>fitted(fit)</code>
are the fitted quantiles, which is the same
as <code>predict(fit, type = "response")</code>.
However, <code>fitted(fit, percentiles = 77)</code>
will not work.

<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>percentiles</code></td>
<td>

<p>Numeric vector, with values between 0 and
100 (although it is not recommended that
exactly 0 or 100 be inputted).  Used only
if <code>type.fitted = "quantiles"</code>
or <code>type.fitted = "percentiles"</code>,
then this argument specifies the values of
these quantiles.  The argument name tries
to reinforce that the values lie between 0
and 100.  See <code>fittedvlm</code> for
more details.

</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>probs.x, probs.y</code></td>
<td>

<p>Numeric, with values in (0, 1).
The probabilites that define quantiles with
respect to some vector, usually an <code>x</code> or
<code>y</code> of some sort.  This is used to create
two subsets of data corresponding to ‘low’
and ‘high’ values of x or y.  Each value is
separately fed into the <code>probs</code> argument
of <code>quantile</code>.
If the data set size is small then it may be
necessary to increase/decrease slightly the
first/second values respectively.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>lss</code></td>
<td>

<p>Logical.
This stands for the ordering: location,
scale and shape.  Should the ordering
of the parameters be in this order?
Almost all <span class="pkg">VGAM</span> family functions
have this order by default, but in order
to match the arguments of existing R
functions, one might need to set
<code>lss = FALSE</code>.  For example, the arguments of
<code>weibullR</code> are scale and shape,
whereas <code>rweibull</code> are
shape and scale.  As a temporary measure
(from <span class="pkg">VGAM</span> 0.9-7 onwards but prior to
version 1.0-0), some family functions such
as <code>sinmad</code> have an <code>lss</code>
argument without a default. For these,
setting <code>lss = FALSE</code> will work.
Later, <code>lss = TRUE</code> will be the default.
Be careful for the <code>dpqr</code>-type functions,
e.g., <code>rsinmad</code>.
</p>
</td>

<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>Thresh</code></td>
<td>

<p><em>Thresholds</em> is another name for the
intercepts, e.g., for categorical models.
They may be constrained by functions such as
<code>CM.equid</code> and
<code>CM.qnorm</code>.
The string <code>"CM."</code> and
the <code>Thresh</code> argument is pasted and
then that function is called to obtain the
constraint matrix for the intercept term.
So
<code>Thresh = "free"</code>,
<code>Thresh = "equid"</code>,
<code>Thresh = "qnorm"</code>,
<code>Thresh = "symm0"</code>,
<code>Thresh = "symm1"</code> etc.
are possibilities.
Families that use this include 
<code>multinomial</code>,
<code>cratio</code>,
<code>sratio</code>,
<code>cumulative</code>,
<code>acat</code>.

Setting <code>TRUE</code> usually results in more
readability but it occupies more columns of
the output.

<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>oim</code></td>
<td>

<p>Logical.
Should the observed information matrices
(OIMs) be used for the working weights?
In general, setting <code>oim = TRUE</code> means
the Newton-Raphson algorithm,
and <code>oim = FALSE</code> means Fisher-scoring.
The latter uses the EIM, and is usually recommended.
If <code>oim = TRUE</code> then <code>nsimEIM</code>
is ignored.
</p>
</td>

<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>nrfs</code></td>
<td>

<p>Numeric, a value in <code class="reqn">[0, 1]</code>.
Experimental argument for allowing a mixture
of Newton-Raphson and Fisher scoring.
The working weights are taken as a linear
combination of the two.  If <code>nrfs = 0</code>
then Newton-Raphson is used, i.e., the OIM
is wholly used.  If <code>nrfs = 1</code> then
Fisher scoring is used, i.e., the EIM is
wholly used.  If convergence is successful
then one might expect Newton-Raphson to
be faster than Fisher scoring because the
former has an order-2 convergence rate
while the latter has a linear rate.

<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>multiple.responses</code></td>
<td>

<p>Logical.
Some <span class="pkg">VGAM</span> family functions allow
a multivariate or vector response.
If so, then usually the response is a
matrix with columns corresponding to the
individual response variables.  They are
all fitted simultaneously.  Arguments such
as <code>parallel</code> may then be useful
to allow for relationships between the
regressions of each response variable.
If <code>multiple.responses = TRUE</code> then
sometimes the response is interpreted
differently, e.g., <code>posbinomial</code>
chooses the first column of a matrix response
as success and combines the other columns as
failure, but when
<code>multiple.responses = TRUE</code>
then each column of the response
matrix is the number of successes and the
<code>weights</code> argument is of the same
dimension as the response and contains the
number of trials.

<td><code>byrow.arg</code></td>
<td>

<p>Logical.
Some <span class="pkg">VGAM</span> family functions that handle
multiple responses have arguments that allow
input to be fed in which affect all the
responses, e.g., <code>imu</code> for initalizing
a <code>mu</code> parameter.  In such cases it is
sometime more convenient to input one value
per response by setting <code>byrow.arg = TRUE</code>;
then values are recycled in order to
form a matrix of the appropriate dimension.
This argument matches <code>byrow</code> in
<code>matrix</code>; in fact it is
fed into such using
<code>matrix(..., byrow = byrow.arg)</code>.
This argument has no effect when there is
one response.

<td><code>ishrinkage</code></td>
<td>

<p>Shrinkage factor <code class="reqn">s</code> used for obtaining
initial values.
Numeric, between 0 and 1.
In general, the formula used is something like
<code class="reqn">s \mu + (1-s) y</code>
where <code class="reqn">\mu</code> is a measure of
central tendency such as a weighted mean or
median, and <code class="reqn">y</code> is the response vector.
For example, the initial values are slight
perturbations of the mean towards the actual
data.  For many types of models this method
seems to work well and is often reasonably
robust to outliers in the response.  Often
this argument is only used if the argument
<code>imethod</code> is assigned a certain value.

<td><code>nointercept</code></td>
<td>

<p>An integer-valued vector specifying

<td><code>bred</code></td>
<td>

<p>Logical.
Some <span class="pkg">VGAM</span> family functions will allow
bias-reduction based on the work by Kosmidis

idea; set <code>stepsize = 0.5</code> and monitor
convergence by setting <code>trace = TRUE</code>.

<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>link.list, earg.list</code></td>
<td>

<p>Some <span class="pkg">VGAM</span> family functions
(such as <code>normal.vcm</code>)
implement models with
potentially lots of parameter link functions.
These two arguments allow many such links and extra arguments
to be inputted more easily.
One has something like
<code>link.list = list</code>
<code>("(Default)" = "identitylink", x2 = "loglink", x3 = "logofflink")</code>
and
<code>earg.list = list</code>
<code>("(Default)" = list(), x2 = list(), x3 = "list(offset = -1)")</code>.
Then any unnamed terms will have the default
link with its corresponding extra argument.
Note: the <code>multilogitlink</code> link
is also possible, and if so, at least two
instances of it are necessary.  Then the last
term is the baseline/reference group.

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Full details will be given in documentation
yet to be written, at a later date!
A general recommendation is to set
<code>trace = TRUE</code> whenever any model fitting
is done, since monitoring convergence is
usually very informative.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>An object of class <code>"vglmff"</code> (see
<code>vglmff-class</code>).  The object
is used by modelling functions such as
<code>vglm</code> and <code>vgam</code>.
</p>


<h3>Warning </h3>

<p>The <code>zero</code> argument is supplied for
convenience but conflicts can arise with other
arguments, e.g., the <code>constraints</code>
argument of <code>vglm</code> and
<code>vgam</code>.  See Example 5 below
for an example.  If not sure, use, e.g.,
<code>constraints(fit)</code> and
<code>coef(fit, matrix = TRUE)</code>
to check the result of a fit <code>fit</code>.
</p>
<p>The arguments <code>zero</code> and
<code>nointercept</code> can be inputted with values
that fail. For example,
<code>multinomial(zero = 2, nointercept = 1:3)</code>
means the second linear/additive predictor is
identically zero, which will cause a failure.
</p>
<p>Be careful about the use of other
potentially contradictory constraints, e.g.,
<code>multinomial(zero = 2, parallel = TRUE ~ x3)</code>.
If in doubt, apply <code>constraints()</code>
to the fitted object to check.
</p>
<p><span class="pkg">VGAM</span> family functions with the
<code>nsimEIM</code> may have inaccurate working
weight matrices. If so, then the standard
errors of the regression coefficients
may be inaccurate. Thus output from
<code>summary(fit)</code>, <code>vcov(fit)</code>,
etc. may be misleading.
</p>
<p>Changes relating to the <code>lss</code> argument
have very important consequences and users
must beware.  Good programming style is
to rely on the argument names and not on
the order.
</p>
