<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The model is formulated exactly as in function <code>anovaMM</code>, i.e. random terms need be enclosed by round brackets.
All terms appearing in the model (fixed or random) need to be compliant with the regular expression "^[^[\.]]?[[:alnum:]_\.]*$",
i.e. they may not start with a dot and may then only consist of alpha-numeric characters, 
dot and underscore. Otherwise, an error will be issued.
</p>
<p>Here, a LMM is fitted by REML using the <code>lmer</code> function of the <code>lme4</code>-package. 
For all models the Giesbrechnt &amp; Burns (1985) approximation of the variance-covariance
matrix of variance components (VC) can be applied ('VarVC=TRUE'). A Satterthwaite approximation of the degrees of freedom
for all VC and total variance is based on this approximated matrix using <code class="reqn">df=2Z^2</code>, where
<code class="reqn">Z</code> is the Wald statistic <code class="reqn">Z=\sigma^2/se(\sigma^2)</code>, and <code class="reqn">\sigma^2</code> is here used for an
estimated variance. The variance of total variability, i.e. the sum of all VC is computed via summing
up all elements of the variance-covariance matrix of the VC.
One can constrain the variance-covariance matrix of random effects <code class="reqn">G</code> to be either diagonal ('cov=FALSE'), i.e.
all random effects are indpendent of each other (covariance is 0). If 'cov=TRUE' (the default) matrix <code class="reqn">G</code> will be
constructed as implied by the model returned by function <code>lmer</code>. 
</p>
<p>As for objects returned by function <code>anovaMM</code> linear hypotheses of fixed effects or LS Means can be
tested with functions <code>test.fixef</code> and <code>test.lsmeans</code>. Note, that option "contain" does
not work for LMM fitted via REML.
</p>
<p>Note, that for large datasets approximating the variance-covariance matrix of VC is computationally expensive
and may take very long. There is no Fisher-information matrix available for 'merMod' objects, which can
serve as approximation. To avoid this time-consuming step, use argument 'VarVC=FALSE' but remember,
that no confidence intervals for any VC will be available. If you use Microsoft's R Open, formerly known
as Revolution-R, which comes with Intel's Math Kernel Library (MKL), this will be automatically detected
and an environment-optimized version will be used, reducing the computational time considerably (see examples).
