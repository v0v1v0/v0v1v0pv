<h2>voiceR test Audio List</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>An audio list containing recordings for ten English-speaking participants.
Interested users can download an extended version of this data set
&lt;a href="https://osf.io/zt5h2/?view_only=348d1d172435449391e8d64547716477"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;
Participants were seated with an experimenter in a sound-isolated room.
All voice recordings were collected using a Blue Yeti Microphone. We used
Audacity version 2.4.2 to record the audio files and saved all files using
a 32-bit WAV format.
Participants were instructed to read the phrase "I go to the bar" in either a happy
or a sad voice. The experimenter requested
each emotion one at a time and in random sequence to counter order effects.
</p>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>'testAudioList'
A list containing 20 Wave objects. Each Wave object has as name its file name.
This file name contains three components separated by an underscore:
</p>

<dl>
<dt>First component</dt>
<dd>
<p>combination of numbers and letters refers to the
participant identifier, i.e., the ID component</p>
</dd>
<dt>Second component</dt>
<dd>
<p>refers to the intention or emotional aspect that
the speaker is conveying: Happy, or Sad. This component makes
reference to the main point that we want to compare in our data; in the
voiceR package the main comparison component is called Condition, because
it usually refers to experimental conditions.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Third component</dt>
<dd>
<p>provides additional information in the voiceR
package. </p>
</dd>
</dl>
