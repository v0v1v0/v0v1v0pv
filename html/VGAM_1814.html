<h2> V2 Missile Hits in London </h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A small count data set.
During WWII V2 missiles were fired from the continent
mainly towards London.
The number of hits per square grid around London were recorded.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data(V2)
</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame with the following variables.
</p>

<dl>
<dt>hits</dt>
<dd>
<p>Values between 0 and 3.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>ofreq</dt>
<dd>
<p>Observed frequency, i.e., the number of grids
with that many hits.
</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The data concerns 408 square grids each of 0.25 square kms
about south London (south of the River Thames).
They were picked in a rectangular region of 102 square kilometres
where the density of hits were roughly uniformly distributed.
The data is somewhat comparable to <code>V1</code> albeit
is a smaller data set.
