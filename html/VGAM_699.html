<h2> Hauck-Donner Effects: A Detection Test for Wald Tests </h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A detection test for the
Hauck-Donner effect on each regression coefficient
of a VGLM regression or 2 x 2 table.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">hdeff(object, ...)
hdeff.vglm(object, derivative = NULL, se.arg = FALSE,
           subset = NULL, theta0 = 0, hstep = 0.005,
           fd.only = FALSE, ...)
hdeff.numeric(object, byrow = FALSE, ...)
hdeff.matrix(object, ...)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>object</code></td>
<td>

<p>Usually a <code>vglm</code> object.
Although only a limited number of family functions have
an analytical solution to
the HDE detection test 
(<code>binomialff</code>,
<code>borel.tanner</code>,
<code>cumulative</code>,
<code>erlang</code>,
<code>felix</code>,
<code>lindley</code>,
<code>poissonff</code>,
<code>topple</code>,
<code>uninormal</code>,
<code>zipoissonff</code>,
and
<code>zipoisson</code>;
hopefully some more will be implemented in the short future!)
the finite-differences (FDs) method can be applied to almost all
<span class="pkg">VGAM</span> family functions to get a numerical solution.
</p>
<p>Alternatively <code>object</code> may represent a 2 x 2 table of
<em>positive</em> counts.
If so, then the first row corresponds
to <code class="reqn">x2=0</code> (baseline group)
and the second row <code class="reqn">x2=1</code>. The first column
corresponds to <code class="reqn">y=0</code> (failure) and
the second column <code class="reqn">y=1</code> (success).
</p>
<p>Another alternative is that <code>object</code> is
a numerical vector
of length 4, representing a 2 x 2 table
of <em>positive</em> counts.
If so then it is fed into <code>hdeff.matrix</code>
using
the argument <code>byrow</code>, which matches
<code>matrix</code>.
See the examples below.
</p>

</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>derivative</code></td>
<td>

<p>Numeric. Either 1 or 2.
Currently only a few models having
one linear predictor are handled
analytically for <code>derivative = 2</code>, e.g.,
<code>binomialff</code>,
<code>poissonff</code>.
However, the numerical method can return the first two
derivatives for almost all models.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>se.arg</code></td>
<td>

<p>Logical. If <code>TRUE</code> then the derivatives
of the standard errors
are returned as well, because usually the derivatives of
the Wald statistics are of central interest.  Requires
<code>derivative</code> to be assigned the value 1 or 2 for this
argument to operate.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>subset</code></td>
<td>

<p>Logical or vector of indices,
to select the regression coefficients of interest.
The default is to select all coefficients.
Recycled if necessary if logical.
If numeric then they should comprise
elements from <code>1:length(coef(object))</code>.
This argument can be useful for computing the derivatives of a
Cox regression (<code>coxph</code>)
fitted using artificially
created Poisson data; then there are many coefficients that
are effectively nuisance parameters.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>theta0</code></td>
<td>

<p>Numeric. Vector recycled to the necessary length which is
the number of regression coefficients.
The null hypotheses for the regression coefficients are that
they equal those respective values, and the alternative
hypotheses are all two-sided.
It is not recommended that argument <code>subset</code> be used
if a vector of values is assigned here because
<code>theta0[subset]</code> is implied and might not work.
</p>

</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>hstep</code></td>
<td>

<p>Positive numeric and recycled to length 2;
it is the so-called <em>step size</em> when using
finite-differences and is often called <code class="reqn">h</code> in
the calculus literature,
e.g., <code class="reqn">f'(x)</code> is approximately <code class="reqn">(f(x+h) - f(x)) / h</code>.
For the 2nd-order partial derivatives, there are two step sizes
and hence this argument is recycled to length 2.
The default is to have the same values.
The 1st-order derivatives use the first value only.
It is recommended that a few values of this argument be tried
because values of the first and second derivatives can
vary accordingly.
If any values are too large then the derivatives
may be inaccurate;
and if too small then the derivatives may be unstable and
subject to too much round-off/cancellation error
(in fact it may create an error or a <code>NA</code>).
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>fd.only</code></td>
<td>

<p>Logical;
if <code>TRUE</code> then finite-differences are used to estimate
the derivatives even if an analytical solution has been
coded, By default, finite-differences will be used when an
analytical solution has not been implemented.
</p>

<p>It is possible that <code>NA</code>s are returned.
If so, and if <code>fd.only = FALSE</code>, then a warning
is issued and a recursive
call is made with <code>fd.only = TRUE</code>—this is more
likely to return an answer without any <code>NA</code>s.
</p>

</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>byrow</code></td>
<td>

<p>Logical;
fed into <code>matrix</code> if <code>object</code> is
a vector of length 4 so that there are two choices in the
order of the elements.
</p>

</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>...</code></td>
<td>

<p>currently unused but may be used in the future for
further arguments passed into the other methods functions.

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Almost all of statistical inference based on the likelihood
assumes that the parameter estimates are located in the interior
of the parameter space.  The nonregular case of being located
on the boundary is not considered very much and leads to
very different results from the regular case.  Practically,
an important question is: how close is close to the boundary?
One might answer this as: the parameter estimates are too close
to the boundary when the Hauck-Donner effect (HDE) is present,
whereby the Wald statistic becomes aberrant.
</p>
<p>Hauck and Donner (1977) first observed an aberration of the
Wald test statistic not monotonically increasing as a function
of increasing distance between the parameter estimate and the
null value.  This "disturbing" and "undesirable" underappreciated
effect has since been observed in other regression models by
various authors.  This function computes the first, and possibly
second, derivative of the Wald statistic for each regression
coefficient.  A negative value of the first derivative is
indicative of the HDE being present.  More information can be
obtained from <code>hdeffsev</code> regarding HDE severity:
there may be none, faint, weak, moderate, strong and extreme
amounts of HDE present.
</p>
<p>In general, most models have derivatives that are computed
numerically using finite-difference
approximations. The reason is that it takes a lot of work
to program in the analytical solution
(this includes a few very common models, such as
<code>poissonff</code> and
<code>binomialff</code>,
where the first two derivatives have been implemented).
</p>



<h3>Value</h3>

<p>By default this function returns a labelled logical vector;
a <code>TRUE</code> means the HDE is affirmative for that coefficient
(negative slope).
Hence ideally all values are <code>FALSE</code>.
Any <code>TRUE</code> values suggests that the MLE is
too near the boundary of the parameter space,
and that the p-value for that regression coefficient
is biased upwards.
When present
a highly significant variable might be deemed nonsignificant,
and thus the HDE can create havoc for variable selection.
If the HDE is present then more accurate
p-values can generally be obtained by conducting a
likelihood ratio test
(see <code>lrt.stat.vlm</code>)
or Rao's score test
(see <code>score.stat.vlm</code>);
indeed the default of
<code>wald.stat.vlm</code>
does not suffer from the HDE.
</p>


<p>Setting <code>deriv = 1</code> returns a numerical vector of first
derivatives of the Wald statistics.
Setting <code>deriv = 2</code> returns a 2-column matrix of first
and second derivatives of the Wald statistics.
Then setting <code>se.arg = TRUE</code> returns an additional 1 or
2 columns.
</p>
<p>Some 2nd derivatives are <code>NA</code> if only a partial analytic
solution has been programmed in.
</p>
<p>For those <span class="pkg">VGAM</span> family functions whose HDE test has not
yet been implemented explicitly (the vast majority of them),
finite-difference approximations to the derivatives will
be used—see the arguments <code>hstep</code> and <code>fd.only</code>
for getting some control on them.
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>The function <code>summaryvglm</code> conducts the HDE
detection test if possible and prints out a line at the bottom
if the HDE is detected for some regression coefficients.
By “if possible”, only a few family functions are exempt and they
have an <code>infos</code> slot with component <code>hadof = FALSE</code>;
such as
<code>normal.vcm</code>,
<code>rec.normal</code> because it
uses the BFGS-IRLS method for computing the working weights.
For these few a <code>NULL</code> is returned by <code>hdeff</code>.
</p>
<p>If the second derivatives are of interest then
it is recommended that <code>crit = "c"</code> be added to the
fitting so that a slightly more accurate model results
(usually one more IRLS iteration).
This is because the FD approximation is very sensitive to
values of the working weights, so they need to be computed
accurately.
Occasionally, if the coefficient is close to 0,
then its Wald statistic's
second derivative may be unusually large in magnitude
(this could be due to something such as roundoff error). 
</p>






<p>This function is currently under development
and may change a little in the short future.
