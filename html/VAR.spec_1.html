<h2>
Allows Specifying a Bivariate VAR (Vector Autoregression) with Desired Spectral Characteristics
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The spectral characteristics of a bivariate series (Marginal Spectra, Coherency- and Phase-Spectrum) determine whether there is a strong presence of short-, medium-, or long-term fluctuations (components of certain frequencies in the spectral representation of the series) in each one of them.  These are induced by strong peaks of the marginal spectra of each series at the corresponding frequencies. The spectral characteristics also determine how strongly these short-, medium-, or long-term fluctuations of the two series are correlated between the two series. Information on this is provided by the Coherency spectrum at the corresponding frequencies. Finally, certain fluctuations of the two series may be lagged to each other. Information on this is provided by the Phase spectrum at the corresponding frequencies. The idea in this package is to define a VAR (Vector autoregression) model with desired spectral characteristics by specifying a number of polynomials, required to define the VAR. See Ioannidis(2007) &lt;doi:10.1016/j.jspi.2005.12.013&gt;. These are specified via their roots, instead of via their coefficients. This is an idea borrowed from the Time Series Library of R. Dahlhaus, where it is used for defining ARMA models for univariate time series. This way, one may e.g. specify a VAR inducing a strong presence of long-term fluctuations in series 1 and in series 2, which are weakly correlated, but lagged by a number of time units to each other, while short-term fluctuations in series 1 and in series 2, are strongly present only in one of the two series, while they are strongly correlated to each other between the two series. Simulation from such models allows studying the behavior of data-analysis tools, such as estimation of the spectra, under different circumstances, as e.g. peaks in the spectra, generating bias, induced by leakage.

                        VAR (Vector autoregression) model.
</pre>
<p>The specification of the VAR (Vector autoregression) model is based on the following fact (see Ioannidis (2007))
</p>
<p>&lt;doi:10.1016/j.jspi.2005.12.013&gt;: 
</p>
<p>For any four complex polynomials <code class="reqn">det(z), cross(z)</code> of degree <code class="reqn">2p</code> and <code class="reqn">chi.1(z), chi.2(z)</code> of degree <code class="reqn">p</code>, satisfying
</p>
<p>EQ(*) </p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><code class="reqn">|det(z)|^2+|cross(z)|^2 = |chi.1(z)|^2 * |chi.2(z)|^2</code>
</p>
<p> on <code class="reqn">|z|=1</code>, there exists a bivariate  VAR(p) with marginal spectra </p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><code class="reqn">f.i (w) = (1/2\pi) |chi.i(z)|^2 /|det(z)|^2,</code>
</p>
<p> and cross-spectrum </p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><code class="reqn">f.1.2 (w) = (1/2\pi) z^{(-p)}cross(z) /|det(z)|^2,</code>
</p>
<p> where <code class="reqn">z=exp(-iw)</code>. The squared Coherency is then given by </p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><code class="reqn">|cross(z)|^2 /(|det(z)|^2+|cross(z)|^2).</code>
</p>

<p>The idea in this package is to define the necessary polynomials by specifying their roots, instead of their coefficients. This is an idea  borrowed from the Time Series Library of R. Dahlhaus,  where it is used for defining ARMA models for univariate time series. 
</p>
<p>Moreover, the package allows the user to specify only some of the roots of <code class="reqn">det(z), cross(z)</code> and <code class="reqn">chi.1(z), chi.2(z)</code>, while it attempts to find further non-specified roots in a way such that EQ(*) is satisfied. 
</p>
<p>By specifying certain roots of <code class="reqn">det(z), cross(z)</code> and <code class="reqn">chi.1(z), chi.2(z)</code> one can induce desired features in the spectra and in the series. For example,
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p> if one wishes a strong presence of frequency <code class="reqn">w_0</code> components in series 1,
there should be a root with modulus close to 1 and angle equal to <code class="reqn">w_0</code>, the multiplicity of which for <code class="reqn">det(z)</code> is higher than its multiplicity for <code class="reqn">chi.1(z)</code>, forcing the spectrum of series 1 to have a peak at <code class="reqn">w_0</code>. 
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> If the frequency-<code class="reqn">w_0</code>-components should be strongly correlated between series 1 and series 2, the multiplicity of this root for <code class="reqn">det(z)</code> should be higher than its multiplicity for <code class="reqn">cross(z)</code>, forcing the Coherency at <code class="reqn">w_0</code> close to 1.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Required polynomials (see argument <code>calc.method</code> of function <code>calculate.VAR</code> and related <code>Details</code>) are first passed to function <code>Init.var</code>, via a <code>data.frame</code> or a text file, which contains the multiplicities of desired roots (rows) for each required polynomial (columns).
</p>
<p>After calling <code>Init.var</code>, function <code>calculate.VAR</code> must be called, which attempts to find a VAR model which is compatible with the polynomials specified in its attribute <code>inv.roots</code>, by making necessary adjustments, calculates its spectra, coefficients and order, makes the necessary checks and plots it's spectra. Then, one can simulate from the specified model calling <code>simulate.VAR</code>.
