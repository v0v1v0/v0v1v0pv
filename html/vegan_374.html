<h2>
Create an Object for Null Model Algorithms
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The <code>commsim</code> function can be used to feed Null Model algorithms into
<code>nullmodel</code> analysis.
The <code>make.commsim</code> function returns various predefined algorithm types
(see Details).
These functions represent low level interface for community null model
infrastructure in <span class="pkg">vegan</span> with the intent of extensibility,
and less emphasis on direct use by users.

</dl>
<p>You can define your own null model, but
several null model algorithm are pre-defined and can be called by
their name. The predefined algorithms are described in detail in the
following chapters. The binary null models produce matrices of zeros
(absences) and ones (presences) also when input matrix is
quantitative. There are two types of quantitative data: Counts are
integers with a natural unit so that individuals can be shuffled, but
abundances can have real (floating point) values and do not have a
natural subunit for shuffling. All quantitative models can handle
counts, but only some are able to handle real values. Some of the null
models are sequential so that the next matrix is derived from the
current one. This makes models dependent from previous models, and usually
you must thin these matrices and study the sequences for stability:
see <code>oecosimu</code> for details and instructions.
</p>
<p>See Examples for structural constraints imposed by each algorithm and
defining your own null model.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>An object of class <code>commsim</code> with elements
corresponding to the arguments (<code>method</code>, <code>binary</code>,
<code>isSeq</code>, <code>mode</code>, <code>fun</code>).
</p>
<p>If the input of <code>make.comsimm</code> is a <code>commsim</code> object,
it is returned without further evaluation. If this is not the case,
the character <code>method</code> argument is matched against
predefined algorithm names. An error message is issued
if none such is found. If the <code>method</code> argument is missing,
the function returns names of all currently available
null model algorithms as a character vector.
</p>


<h3>Binary null models</h3>

<p>All binary null models preserve fill: number of presences or
conversely the number of absences. The classic models may also
preserve column (species) frequencies (<code>c0</code>) or row frequencies
or species richness of each site (<code>r0</code>) and take into account
commonness and rarity of species (<code>r1</code>, <code>r2</code>).  Algorithms
<code>swap</code>, <code>tswap</code>, <code>curveball</code>, <code>quasiswap</code> and
<code>backtracking</code> preserve both row and column frequencies. Three
first ones are sequential but the two latter are non-sequential
and produce independent matrices. Basic algorithms are reviewed by
Wright et al. (1998).
</p>

<dl>
<dt>
<code>"r00"</code>: </dt>
<dd>
<p>non-sequential algorithm for binary matrices
that only  preserves the number of presences (fill).</p>
</dd>
<dt>
<code>"r0"</code>: </dt>
<dd>
<p>non-sequential algorithm for binary
matrices that preserves the site (row) frequencies.</p>
</dd>
<dt>
<code>"r1"</code>: </dt>
<dd>
<p>non-sequential algorithm for binary matrices
that preserves the site (row) frequencies, but uses column marginal
frequencies as probabilities of selecting species.</p>
</dd>
<dt>
<code>"r2"</code>: </dt>
<dd>
<p>non-sequential algorithm for binary matrices
that preserves the site (row) frequencies, and uses squared column
marginal frequencies as as probabilities of selecting species.</p>
</dd>
<dt>
<code>"c0"</code>: </dt>
<dd>
<p>non-sequential algorithm for binary matrices
that preserves species frequencies (Jonsson 2001). </p>
</dd>
<dt>
<code>"swap"</code>: </dt>
<dd>
<p>sequential algorithm for binary matrices that
changes the matrix structure, but does not influence marginal sums
(Gotelli &amp; Entsminger 2003).  This inspects <code class="reqn">2 \times 2</code> submatrices so long that a swap can be done.</p>
</dd>
<dt>
<code>"tswap"</code>: </dt>
<dd>
<p>sequential algorithm for binary matrices.
Same as the <code>"swap"</code> algorithm, but it tries a fixed
number of times and performs zero to many swaps at one step
(according to the thin argument in the call). This
approach was suggested by Miklós &amp; Podani (2004)
because they found that ordinary swap may lead to biased
sequences, since some columns or rows are more easily swapped.</p>
</dd>
<dt>
<code>"curveball"</code>: </dt>
<dd>
<p>sequential method for binary matrices that
implements the ‘Curveball’ algorithm of Strona et
al. (2014). The algorithm selects two random rows and finds the set
of unique species that occur only in one of these rows. The
algorithm distributes the set of unique species to rows preserving
the original row frequencies.  Zero to several species are swapped
in one step, and usually the matrix is perturbed more strongly than
in other sequential methods.</p>
</dd>
<dt>
<code>"quasiswap"</code>: </dt>
<dd>
<p>non-sequential algorithm for binary
matrices that implements a method where matrix is first filled
honouring row and column totals, but with integers that may be
larger than one.  Then the method inspects random
<code class="reqn">2 \times 2</code> matrices and performs a quasiswap on
them. In addition to ordinary swaps, quasiswap can reduce numbers
above one to ones preserving marginal totals (Miklós &amp;
Podani 2004). The method is non-sequential, but it accepts
<code>thin</code> argument: the convergence is checked at every
<code>thin</code> steps. This allows performing several ordinary swaps in
addition to fill changing swaps which helps in reducing or removing
the bias.</p>
</dd>
<dt>
<code>"greedyqswap"</code>: </dt>
<dd>
<p>A greedy variant of quasiswap. In
greedy step, one element of the <code class="reqn">2 \times 2</code> matrix is
taken from <code class="reqn">&gt; 1</code> elements. The greedy steps are biased, but
the method can be thinned, and only the first of <code>thin</code>
steps is greedy. Even modest thinning (say <code>thin = 20</code>)
removes or reduces the bias, and <code>thin = 100</code> (1% greedy
steps) looks completely safe and still speeds up simulation. The
code is experimental and it is provided here for further scrutiny,
and should be tested for bias before use.</p>
</dd>
<dt>
<code>"backtracking"</code>: </dt>
<dd>
<p>non-sequential algorithm for binary
matrices that implements a filling method with constraints both for
row and column frequencies (Gotelli &amp; Entsminger 2001).  The matrix
is first filled randomly, but typically row and column sums are
reached before all incidences are filled in. After this begins
"backtracking", where some of the incidences are removed, and
filling is started again, and this backtracking is done so many
times that all incidences will be filled into matrix.  The results
may be biased and should be inspected carefully before use.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h3>Quantitative Models for Counts with Fixed Marginal Sums</h3>

<p>These models shuffle individuals of counts and keep marginal sums
fixed, but marginal frequencies are not preserved. Algorithm
<code>r2dtable</code> uses standard <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier; color: #666666;"><b>R</b></span> function <code>r2dtable</code> also
used for simulated <code class="reqn">P</code>-values in <code>chisq.test</code>.
Algorithm <code>quasiswap_count</code> uses the same, but preserves the
original fill. Typically this means increasing numbers of zero cells
and the result is zero-inflated with respect to <code>r2dtable</code>.
</p>

<dl>
<dt>
<code>"r2dtable"</code>: </dt>
<dd>
<p>non-sequential algorithm for count
matrices.  This algorithm keeps matrix sum and row/column sums
constant. Based on <code>r2dtable</code>.</p>
</dd>
<dt>
<code>"quasiswap_count"</code>: </dt>
<dd>
<p>non-sequential algorithm for count
matrices.  This algorithm is similar as Carsten Dormann's
<code>swap.web</code> function in the package
<span class="pkg">bipartite</span>. First, a random matrix is generated by the
<code>r2dtable</code> function preserving row and column sums.  Then
the original matrix fill is reconstructed by sequential steps to
increase or decrease matrix fill in the random matrix. These steps
are based on swapping <code class="reqn">2 \times 2</code> submatrices (see
<code>"swap_count"</code> algorithm for details) to maintain row and
column totals. </p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h3>Quantitative Swap Models</h3>

<p>Quantitative swap models are similar to binary <code>swap</code>, but they
swap the largest permissible value. The models in this section all
maintain the fill and perform a quantitative swap only if this can
be done without changing the fill. Single step of swap often changes
the matrix very little. In particular, if cell counts are variable,
high values change very slowly. Checking the chain stability and
independence is even more crucial than in binary swap, and very
strong <code>thin</code>ning is often needed. These models should never be
used without inspecting their properties for the current data. These
null models can also be defined using <code>permatswap</code>
function.
</p>

<dl>
<dt>
<code>"swap_count"</code>: </dt>
<dd>
<p>sequential algorithm for count matrices.
This algorithm find <code class="reqn">2 \times 2</code> submatrices that can be
swapped leaving column and row totals and fill unchanged. The
algorithm finds the largest value in the submatrix that can be
swapped (<code class="reqn">d</code>). Swap means that the values in diagonal or
antidiagonal positions are decreased by <code class="reqn">d</code>, while remaining
cells are increased by <code class="reqn">d</code>. A swap is made only if fill does not
change.  </p>
</dd>
<dt>
<code>"abuswap_r"</code>: </dt>
<dd>
<p>sequential algorithm for count or
nonnegative real valued matrices with fixed row frequencies (see
also <code>permatswap</code>).  The algorithm is similar to
<code>swap_count</code>, but uses different swap value for each row of the
<code class="reqn">2 \times 2</code> submatrix. Each step changes the the
corresponding column sums, but honours matrix fill, row sums, and
row/column frequencies (Hardy 2008; randomization scheme 2x).</p>
</dd>
<dt>
<code>"abuswap_c"</code>: </dt>
<dd>
<p>sequential algorithm for count or
nonnegative real valued matrices with fixed column frequencies
(see also <code>permatswap</code>).  The algorithm is similar as
the previous one, but operates on columns.  Each step changes the
the corresponding row sums, but honours matrix fill, column sums,
and row/column frequencies (Hardy 2008; randomization scheme 3x).</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h3>Quantitative Swap and Shuffle Models</h3>

<p>Quantitative Swap and Shuffle methods (<code>swsh</code> methods) preserve
fill and column and row frequencies, and also either row or column
sums. The methods first perform a binary <code>quasiswap</code> and then
shuffle original quantitative data to non-zero cells. The
<code>samp</code> methods shuffle original non-zero cell values and can be
used also with non-integer data. The <code>both</code> methods
redistribute individuals randomly among non-zero cells and can only
be used with integer data. The shuffling is either free over the
whole matrix, or within rows (<code>r</code> methods) or within columns
(<code>c</code> methods). Shuffling within a row preserves row sums, and
shuffling within a column preserves column sums. These models can
also be defined with <code>permatswap</code>.
</p>

<dl>
<dt>
<code>"swsh_samp"</code>: </dt>
<dd>
<p>non-sequential algorithm for
quantitative data (either integer counts or non-integer values).
Original non-zero values values are shuffled.</p>
</dd>
<dt>
<code>"swsh_both"</code>: </dt>
<dd>
<p>non-sequential algorithm for count data.

</dd>

</dd>
<dt>
<code>"swsh_both_c"</code>: </dt>
<dd>
<p>non-sequential algorithm for count matrices.
Individuals are shuffled freely for non-zero values with each column.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h3>Quantitative Shuffle Methods</h3>

<p>Quantitative shuffle methods are generalizations of binary models
<code>r00</code>, <code>r0</code> and <code>c0</code>.  The <code>_ind</code> methods
shuffle individuals so that the grand sum, row sum or column sums
are preserved.  These methods are similar as <code>r2dtable</code> but
with still slacker constraints on marginal sums. The <code>_samp</code>
and <code>_both</code> methods first apply the corresponding binary model
with similar restriction on marginal frequencies and then distribute
quantitative values over non-zero cells. The <code>_samp</code> models
shuffle original cell values and can therefore handle also non-count
real values. The <code>_both</code> models shuffle individuals among
non-zero values. The shuffling is over the whole matrix in
<code>r00_</code>, and within row in <code>r0_</code> and within column in
<code>c0_</code> in all cases.
